<h1>The York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus<br> of Old English Prose</h1>
<h2>Texts included in the corpus</h2>
<p><br>

The files below list the texts included in the corpus in different ways,
with links to information about each text. Information about Helsinki
Corpus conventions can be found <a
href="http://khnt.hit.uib.no/icame/manuals/HC/INDEX.HTM">here</a>.

<ul>

<li> Dialect information comes from the Helsinki Corpus and is only
provided for texts which were included in that corpus.  The elements of
mixed dialects are separated by a slash. X as a dialect designation
indicates unknown.

<li> Genre information is that of the Helsinki corpus for Helskinki
texts. For non-Helsinki texts it has been provided by the YCOE team.

<li> The manuscript date is that given in Ker (Catalogue of Manuscripts
containing Anglo-Saxon, 1957). For Charters and Wills (files beginning
"codocu"), instead of manuscript and date, we supply the Sawyer number
(Anglo-Saxon Charters: An annotated list and bibliography, 1968) by means
of which manuscript and date can be obtained.

<li> Texts are characterized as to whether they are Latin translations, the
three values being <b>yes, no</b> and <b>?</b> for unknown or uncertain
cases. Unknown does not mean that it is not known, only that we do not
know. Some of this information is provided by the Helsinki Corpus and some
by the YCOE team.
