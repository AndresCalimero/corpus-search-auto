The Portugals striving to possess themselves of Muschat, were put to such
stress, that had not their Armado come to their relief, they must have
desisted their Enterprize: Upon the arrival whereof the new Recruits gained so
much on the Arab Governour, that he yielded up the otherwise invincible Fort
of Muschat; where the Portugals acting all nefarious Outrages, contrary to
their Promise, the Arabs re-armed themselves with Courage and fresh Succors,
and at length beat them from hence to Ormus in the Gulf of Persia; from whence
also they were routed by the help of the English we then being at war with
them; the first blow to their Greatness in these Parts.

of Rocks were made for no other end but to counterpoize the more Fruitful Part

have drawn Breath in this Place, had not the late unusual Rain something
allayed the Fury of the Heats, which yet were troublesome enough by reason of
the steaming Mists arising boiling hot with the Sun; which so late in the Year
are by the most Ancient of this Country esteemed so far out of course, that
their Memory fails them to relate the like.
