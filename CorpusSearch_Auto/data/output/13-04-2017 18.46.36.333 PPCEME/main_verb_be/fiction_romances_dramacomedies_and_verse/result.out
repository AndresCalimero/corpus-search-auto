Oroonoko coming from the wars which were now ended after he had made his court
to his grandfather, he thought in honour he ought to make a visit to Imoinda,
the daughter of his foster-father, the dead general; and to make some excuses
to her, because his preservation was the occasion of her father's death; and
to present her with those slaves that had been taken in this last battle, as
the trophies of her father's victories.

The captain pondering and consulting what to do, it was concluded that nothing
but Oroonoko 's liberty would encourage any of the rest to eat, except the
Frenchman, whom the captain could not pretend to keep prisoner, but only told
him, he was secured, because he might act something in favour of the prince,
but that he should be freed as soon as they came to land. So that they
concluded it wholly necessary to free the prince from his irons, that he might
shew himself to the rest; that they might have an eye upon him, and that they
could not fear a single man.

He reflecting on the last words of Oroonoko to the captain, and beholding the
richness of his vest, no sooner came into the boat, but he fix'd his eyes on
him; and finding something so extraordinary in his face, his shape and mein, a
greatness of look, and haughtiness in his air, and finding he spoke English,
had a great mind to be enquiring into his quality and fortune: which, though
Oroonoko endeavour'd to hide, by only confessing he was above the rank of
common slaves; Trefry soon found he was yet something greater than he
confess'd; and from that moment began to conceive so vast an esteem for him,

in the beginning of his reigne, Iohn Winchcomb, a broad cloth Weauer, dwelt in
Newberie, a towne in Barkshire: who for that he was a man of a merry
disposition, and honest conuersation, was wondrous wel-beloued of Rich and
Poore, especiallie because in euery place where hee came, hee would spend his
money with the best, and was not at any time found a churle of his purse.
Wherefore beeing so good a companion, he was called of old and young Iack of
Newbery: a man so generally well knowne in all his countrey for his good
fellowship, that hee could goe in no place but hee found acquaintance; by
meanes whereof Iack could no sooner get a Crowne, but straight hee found
meanes to spend it:

for you shall vnderstand that the Scottish King made full account to bee Lord
of this land, watching opportunitie to bring to passe his faithlesse and
trayterous practise: which was when our King was in France, at Turney, and
Turwin: in regard of which warres, the Scots vaunted there was none left in
England, but shepheards and ploughmen, who were not able to lead an army,
hauing no skill in martiall affaires. In consideration of which aduantage, hee
inuaded the Countrey, boasting of victorie befor hee had wonne: which was no
small griefe to Queene Margaret his wife, who was eldest Sister to our noble
King. Wherefore in disgrace of the Scots, and in remembrance of the famous

proude Prelate, by whose meanes great variance was set betwixt the King of
England and the French King, the Emperour of Almaine, and diuers other Princes
of Christendome, whereby the trafficke of those Merchants was vtterly
forbidden, which bred a generall woe through England, especially among
Clothiers: insomuch that hauing no sale for their cloath, they were faine to
put away many of their people which wrought for them, as hereafter more at

he says $'t $is impossible to love where we $can $not esteem; and that no
Woman can be esteem'd by a Man who has sense, if she makes her self cheap in
the Eye of a Fool. That Pride to a Woman, is as necessary as Humility to a
Divine; and that far-fetch'd, and dear bought, is Meat for Gentlemen, as well
as for Ladies - In short, that every Woman who has Beauty, may set a price
upon her self, and that by under-selling the Market, they ruin the Trade.
