But that Gentlemans never appearing was a great snare to him, during the rest
of his life. Though when he told me this, he could not but acknowledge, it was
as unreasonable thing for him, to think, that Beings in another State were not
under such Laws and Limits, that they could not command their own motions, but
as the Supream Power should order them: and that one who had so corrupted the
Natural Principles of Truth, as he had, had no reason to expect that such an
extraordinary thing should be done for his Conviction.

For Morality, he freely own'd to me, that though he talked of it, as a fine
thing, yet this was only because he thought it a decent way of speaking, and
that as they went always in Cloaths, though in their Frollicks they would have
chosen sometimes to have gone naked, if they had not feared the people: So
though some of them found it necessary for humane life to talk of Morality,
yet he confessed they cared not for it, further than the reputation of it was
necessary for their credit, and affairs: of which he gave me many Instances,
as their professing and swearing Friendship, where they hated mortally; their
Oaths and Imprecations in their Addresses to Women, which they intended never
to make good; the pleasure they took in defaming innocent Persons, and
spreading false Reports of some, perhaps in Revenge, because they could not
enage them to comply with their ill Designs: The delight they had in making
people quarrel; their unjust usage of their Creditors, and putting them off by
any deceitful Promise they could invent, that might deliver them from present
Importunity. So that in detestation of these Courses he would often break
forth into such hard Expressions concerning himself as would be indecent for
another to repeat.

Having understood all these things from him, and being pressed to give him my
Opinion plainly about his Eternal State; I told him, That though the Promises
of the Gospel did all depend upon a real change of Heart and Life, as the
indispensable condition upon which they were made; and that it was scarce
possible to know certainly whether our Hearts are changed, unless it appeared
in our lives; and the Repentance of most dying men, being like the howlings of
condemned Prisoners for Pardon, which flowed from no sense of their Crimes,
but from the horrour of approaching Death; there was little reason to
encourage any to hope much from such Sorrowing: Yet certainly if the Mind of a
Sinner, even on a Death-Bed, be truly renewed and turned to God, so great is
His Mercy, that He will receive him, even in that extremity.

with some helps suitable to their Nature. And that it could not be imagined,
that those who imitated him, should not be specially favoured by him and
therefore since this did not appear in this State, it was most reasonable to
think it should be in another, where the Rewards shall be an admission to a
more perfect State of Conformity to God, with the felicity that follows it,
and the Punishments should be a total exclusion from him, with all the horrour

many things within their care, as the Eye can at one view receive a great

conceive the Divine Understanding to be as far above ours, as his Power of
creating and framing the whole Universe, is above our limited activity; We
will no more think the Government of the World a distraction to him:

Yet such a believing as this, is only a general perswasion in the Mind, which
has not that effect, till a man applying himself to the Directions set down in
the Scriptures which upon such Evidence $can $not be denied, to be as
reasonable, as for a man to follow the Prescriptions of a learned Physitian,
and when the Rules are both good and easie, to submit to them for the
recovering of his health and by following these, finds a power entring within
him, that frees him from the slavery of his Appetites and Passions, that
exalts his Mind above the accidents of life and spreads an inward purity in
his Heart, from which a serene and calm joy arises within him:

knowledge of the Language in which it was writ, have so imperfect an account
of the History of those Ages, know nothing of their Customs, Forms of Speech,
and the several Periods they might have, by which they reckoned their time,
that it is rather a wonder We should understand so much of it, than that many

There might be as many hard Arguments brought against the possibility of these
things, which yet every one knows to be true, from Speculative Notions, as
against the Mysteries mentioned in the Scriptures. As that of the Trinity,
That in one Essence there are three different Principles of Operation, which,
for want of terms fit to express them by, We call Persons, and are called in
Scripture The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that the Second of these did
unite Himself in a most intimate manner with the Humane Nature of Jesus Christ:
And that the Sufferings he underwent, were accepted of God as a Sacrifice for
our Sins; Who thereupon conferred on Him a Power of granting Eternal Life to
all that submit to the Terms on which He offers it; And that the matter of
which our Bodies once consisted, which may be as justly called the Bodies we
laid down at our Deaths, as these can be said to be the Bodies which We
formerly lived in, being refined and made more spiritual, shall be reunited to
our Souls, and become a fit Instrument for them in a more perfect Estate: And
that God inwardly bends and moves our Wills, by such Impressions, as he can
make on our Bodies and Minds.

For it is an absurd Inference from our being bound to assent to some Truths
about the Divine Essence, of which the manner is not understood to argue that
therefore in an Object presented duly to our Senses such as Bread and Wine, We
should be bound to believe against their Testimony, that it is not what our

He told me, He saw Vice and Impiety were as contrary to Humane Society, as
wild Beasts let loose would be; and therefore he firmly resolved to change the
whole method of his Life: to become strictly just and true, to be Chast and
Temperate, to forbear Swearing and Irreligious Discourse, to Worship and Pray
to his Maker: And that though he was not arrived at a full perswasion of
Christianity, he would never employ his Wit more to run it down, or to corrupt
others. Of which I have since a further assurance, from a Person of Quality,
who conversed much with him, the last year of his life; to whom he would often
say, That he was happy, if he did believe, and that he would never endeavour
to draw him from it.

bringing that into Custome, which was onely indulged in case of iminent danger:
& out of necessity, during the Rebellion and persecution of the Cleargy, in
our late Civil Warres &c: The other from the Avarice of the Minister, who made
in some opulent parishes, almost as much of permissions to bury in the
chancels & churches, as of their livings, and were paid with considerable

I went after all publique devotions were finish'd to visite the Bishop of St.

of Paules Dr Tenison &c: all of them not a little surpriz'd at what had
happned in Savoy, among the Voudois, who being so neere their destruction &
final extirpation by the French, as that they were generaly given up as to
slaughter, & that every body expected to heare of their calamities & final
destruction: It pleased God $that the Duke of Savoy hitherto joyning with the
French in persecution of those poore Christians, & now pressed by the French
to deliver $Verrue & Turin as Cautionary to the French, upon their suspicion
that he might at last come into the German Princes Confederacy having
seacretly concerted with the Confederats, & adjusted the Condition &c, not
onely declared for the Confederats, but invited those poore Christians from
their dispersions & Latebrae among the Mountain whither they had fled; but
restor'd them to their Country, Dwellings, Exercise of the Religion, beged
pardon for the ill usage they had received, & charging it upon the cruelty of
the French, who forced him to it &c: These being the Remainder of those
persecuted Christians, $whom the Bishop had so long time, affirmed to be the 2
Wittnesses spoken of in the Revelation who should be Kild, & brought to life

did declare that there was no law against taking the oath of children above

Only this much may be alledged as an Annotation not Impertinent in this matter,

by bringinge of false Reports, and doeinge of evill Offices betwixt the Erle
of Essex and Sir John Perrott sought to incence and sette them farther asunder,
then otherwise they would have byn; soe is it usual that, in most Places,
Personages of best Quallitie and Reputation are devided in Love, and sometimes
seperated from all mutuall Societie if not driven into Discord and Disention,
by such as, to serve theyr owne Turnes, are allway soe apte to nourishe

For Cardinall Wolsey, a man very ambitious, and desirous as good hope and
likelyhod he had to aspire vnto that dignity, perceaving himself of his
expectacion disapointed, by meanes of the Emperour $Chareles so highely
comendinge one Cardinall Adrian, sometyme his scholemaster, to the Cardinalls
of Roome, in the tyme of their election, for his vertue and worthines, that
therevppon was he chosen Pope; who from Spayne, where he was then resident,
cominge on foote to Roome, before his entry into the Citye, did put of his
hosen and showes, barefoote and barlegged passing throwe the streates towards
his pallaice, with such humblenes that all the people had him in greate
reuerence; Cardinall Wolsey, I say, waxed so wood therwith, that he studied to
invent all waies of reuengment of his grief against the Emperour; which, as it
was the begininge of a lamentable tragedye, so some parte of it as not
impertinent to my present purpose, I recknid requisite here to put in
remembraunce.

before rehersed to the Comissioners into England, the kinge, taking the matter

either in his tyme had alredy passed, or at that present depended in any of
the kings Courtes at westminster before him. Which done, he invited all the
Judges to dyne with him in the councell chamber at westminster: where, after
dynner, when he had broken with them what complaintes he had heard of his
Iniunctions, and moreouer shewed them bothe the number and causes of euery one
of them, in order, so plainely that, vppon full debating of thos matters, they
were all inforced to confes that they, in like case, could haue done no other
wise themselfes, Then offred he this vnto them: that if the Iustices of euery
courte vnto whom the reformacion of the rigour of the lawe, by reason of their
office, most especially appertained wold, vppon resonable considerations, by
their owne discretions as they were, as he thought, in consciens bound
mitigate and reforme the rigour of the lawe themselves, there should from
thenceforth by him no more Iniunctions be graunted. Wherunto when they refused
to condiscend, then said he vnto them: "Forasmuch as your selves, my lordes,

And as litle leysure as he had to be occupied in the study of holy scripture
and controuersies vppon religion and such other vertuous exercises, being in
manner contynually busied about thaffaires of the kinge and the realme, yeat
such watche and payne in setting forth of divers profitable workes, in defens
of the true $Christian religion, against hereseies secreatly sowen abrode in
the Realme, assuredly sustayned he, that the Byshoppes, to whose pastorall
cure $the $reformacione thereof principally appertained, thinking themselfes
by his travaile, wherein by their owne confession they were not able with him
to make comparison, of their duties in that behalf discharged, And considering
that for all his princes favour he was no rich man, nor in yearly revenues
advaunced as his worthines deserved; Therefore, at a convocation among
themselfes and other of the clergie, they agreed together and concluded vppon
a some of foure or five thowsand poundes, at the least, to my remembraunce,
for his paynes to recompence him. To the payment whereof euery Byshop, Abbott,
and the rest of the Clergye were, after the rate $of $their $abillityes,
liberall contributories, hoping this porcion should be to his contentation.
Whervppon Tunstall, Bishopp of Dirham, Clark, Bishopp of Bath, and, as farr as
I can call to mind, Vaysey, Bishop of Exeter, repayred vnto him, declaring
howe thanckfully for his travailes, to their discharge, in godes cause
bestowed, they reckned themselves bounden to consider him; And that albeit
they could not, according to his desertes, so worthily as they gladly wold,
requite him therefore, but must reserve that only to the goodnes of god, yeat
for a small parte of recompense, in respecte of his estate so vnequall to his
worthines, in the name of their whole convocacion, they presented vnto him
that some, which they desired him to take in good parte. Who, forsaking it,
said, That like as it was no small comforte vnto him that so wise and learned
men so well accepted his simple doings, for which he never intended to receiue
reward but at thands of god onlye, to whom alone was the thanck thereof
cheefly to be ascribed, So gaue he most hvmble thanckes to their honours all
for their $so bountiffull $and $freindly consideration.

This Sir Thomas Moore, amonge all other his vertues, was of suche meeknes that
if it had fortuned him with any learned men resortinge to him from Oxford,
Cambridge, or els where, as there did divers, some for desire of his
acquaintaunce, some for the famous reporte of his wisdome and learning, and
some for suites of the vniuersityes, to haue entered into argvment, wherein
fewe were comparable vnto him, and so farre to have discoursed with them
therein that he might perceiue they coulde not, without some inconveiens, hold
out much further disputacion against him: Then, least he should discomforte
them, as he that sought out not his owne glory, but rather wold seeme
conquered then to discourage studentes in their studies, euer shewinge himself
more desirous to learne then to teache, wold he by some witty devise
courteouslye breake of into some other matter, and geeve over. Of whom, for
his wisdome and learninge, had the kinge suche an opinion, that at suche tyme
as he attended vppon his highnes, takinge his progresse either to oxford or
Cambridge, where he was receaved with very eloquent orations, his grace wold
alwaies assigne him, as one that was prompte and ready therein, ex tempore to
make awneswer therevnto. Whose manner was, whensoeuer he had occasion, either
here or beyond the sea, to be in any vniuersity, not onely to be present at
the readinge and $disputations there comonly vsed, but also learnedly to
dispute amonge them himself. Who, beinge Chauncelour of the duchie, was made
Embassador twice, ioyned in Comission with Cardinall Wolsey, once to $the
Emperour Charels into Flaunders, the other tyme to the French kinge into
Fraunce.
