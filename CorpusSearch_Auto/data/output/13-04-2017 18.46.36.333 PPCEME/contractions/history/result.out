redeem themselves from the censures and jealousies that these brought on them

themselves and their party as impious and ridiculous.

The letters did cast a very great blemish not only on lord Danby but on the
king, who, after he had entered into alliances, and had received great
supplies from his people to carry on a war, was thus treating with France for
money, which could not be asked or obtained from France on any other account,
but that of making the confederates accept of lower terms than otherwise they
would have stood on; which was indeed the selling of the allies and of the
public faith.

When they were come, and had setled themselves to attentione, Doctor Heath,
Archbishop of Yorke, and Lord Chauncelor of England, with a composed
countenance and voice, as neither glad at the death of the old Prince, nor
discontended at the new, declared to them the assured advertisement of the
death of the Queene: That albeit the Parliament by this heavy accident did
dissolve, yet for that they had bin elected to represent the common people of
the Realme, and to deale for them in matters of estate, they could noe waye
better dischardge that trust, then in joyninge with the Lords to publish the
next Successour to the Crowne: That the right and title of Lady Elizabeth,
sister to the deceased Queene, and onely daughter then surviving of King Henry
the Eighth, was esteemed by the Lords free from all quarrell, free from all
questione and doubt: that in no case expeditione is more expedient, than in
these high passages of State, for extinguishing as well the vayne hopes of
enemyes, as the false and needelesse feares of friendes: that for this cause
the Lords had desired their presence, that, with joynt consent of the whole
assembly, the Lady Elizabeth might forthwith be proclaymed Queene.

Whilst this mutatione was in working the Queene was not negligent to winne the
love of London, by supporting the liberties of the City; to gayne the good
will of the Countrie, by erecting a military discipline in every shire, and by
giving pensiones and preferments to men of actione; which wrought exceeding
both contentement and assurance, to all the realme; alsoe to hold men of worth
in expectatione and hope, by taking a list of the most worthy men in every
kind, with such alsoe who had served her father, brother, or sister; whoe were
fitted eyther with advancement or suites, agreeable both to their quality and
meritt; lastly, to procure favour from the common people, by relieving them
against the exactiones of inferior officeres, not onely by setting downe
strict orderes against their abuses, but by severe executiones of them. In so
much as, by speciall appoyntement from herselfe, a purveiour which sort of
officers since the destruction of wolves have been reputed the most noisome
and vile vermin in the realme, who had taken smelts for her provisione, and
sold them agayne at a higher price was sett three dayes upon the pillory in
Cheapside, a bawdricke of smelts about his necke, and uppon his foorehead a

establish'd by succession, finding thir power arrive well nigh at the utmost

for France, after Justus and Mellitus, the story goes, if it be worth
beleeving, that St. Peter, in whose Church he spent the night before in
watching and praying, appear'd to him, and to make the Vision more sensible,
gave him many stripes for offering to desert his flock; at sight whereof the
King to whom next morning he shew'd the marks of what he had suffer'd, by whom
and for what cause relenting and in great fear dissolv'd his incestuous
marriage, and appli'd himself to the Christian Faith more sincerely then
before, with all his people.

In Kent, Lothair dy'd this year of his wounds receav'd in fight against the
South-Saxons, led on by Edric, who descending from Ermenred, it seems
challeng'd the Crown; and wore it, though not commendably, one year and a half:
but coming to a violent Death, left the land expos'd a prey either to
home-bred usurpers, or neighbouring invaders. Among whom Kedwalla, taking
advantage from thir civil distempers, and marching easily through the
South-Saxons, whom he had subdu'd, sorely harrass'd the Country, untouch'd of
a long time by any hostile incursion.
