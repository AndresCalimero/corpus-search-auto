Because there is no proportion, comparison, or likenes betwixt a right line
and a crooked, the auntient Philosophers, as Ptolomey and divers other, were
much troubled in seeking to know the measures of a Circle or of any portion
thereof by his Diameter, and by knowing the Diameter to finde out the length
of any Chorde in a circle, which is alwaies lesser then the Diameter it selfe,

howers maketh one hower 1'.2". and somewhat more, which being added to 6.
maketh 7. howers 1'. 2". and a little more: which is the one half of the

unless they be warm'd; which Rule though I have now and then found to admit of
an Exception, whereof I elsewhere offer an account, yet, as to the generality

It has been also observed, that the effects of Electrical Attraction are
weaken'd if the air be thick and cloudy; and especially if the Southwind blows:
And that Electricks display their vertue more faintly by night than by day,
and more vigorously in clear weather, and when the winds are Northerly. All
which the Learned Kircherus asserts himself to have found true by experience;
insomuch that those bodies that are but faintly drawn when the weather is
clear, will not, when $'t $is thick and cloudy, be at all moved.

For the Attrition having caus'd an intestine commotion in the parts of the
Concrete, the heat or warmth that is thereby excited ought not to cease, as
soon as ever the rubbing is over, but to continue capable of emitting Effluvia
for some time afterwards, which will be longer or shorter according to the
goodness of the Electric, and the degree of the Antecedent commotion: which
joyn'd together may sometimes make the effect considerable, insomuch that in a

and though I was not satisfi'd that it did either attract the flame, as it
visibly did the smoak, or manifestly agitate it; yet granting that Gilbert's
Assertion will constantly hold true, and so, that flame is to be excepted from
the general Rule, yet this exception may well comport with the Hypothesis
hitherto countenanc'd, since it may be said, as $'t $is, if I mistake not, by
Kirkerus, that the heat of the flame dissipates the Effluvia, by whose means
the Attraction should be perform'd. To which I shall adde, that possibly the
Celerity of the motion of the Flame upwards, may render it very difficult for
the Electrical Emanations to divert the Flame from its Course.

And as in many cases one contrary directs to another, so this Trial suggested
a further, which, in case of good success, would probably argue, that in
Electrical Attraction not onely Effluvia are emitted by the Electrical body,
but these Effluvia fasten upon the body to be drawn, and that in such a way,
that the intervening viscous strings, which may be supposed to be made up of
those cohering Effluvia, are, when their agitation ceases, contracted or made
to shrink inwards towards both ends, almost as a highly strech'd Lute-string
does when $'t $is permitted to retreat into shorter Dimensions.

lost its colour being burnt quite black, and though it were grown strangely

attracting light Bodies to flow from the substantial form of Amber, would not
expect it in a Body so changed and deprived of its noblest parts: Yet this
Caput mortuum was so far from having lost its Electrical Faculty, that it
seemed to attract more vigorously than Amber it self is wont to do before it

Some years after the making the Experiments about the Production of
Electricity, having a desire to try, whether in the Attractions made by Amber,
the motions excited by the air had a considerable Interest, or whether the
Effect were not due rather to the Emission and Retraction of Effluvia, which
being of a viscous nature may consist of Particles either branch'd or hookt,
or otherwise fit for some kind of Cohesion, and capable of being stretch'd,
and of shrinking again, as Leather Thongs are: To examine this, I say, I
thought the fittest way, if $'t $were practicable, would be, to try, whether
Amber would draw a light Body in a Glass whence the air was pumpt out.

far from having the softness of an Emrald, that he found it harder than blew
Saphyrs themselves, which yet are Gems of great hardness, and by some reputed
second to none, but Diamonds.

And this brings to my mind, that it has been observed, that Diamonds draw
better whilst rough, than they do after they are cut and polish'd; which
seeming to contradict what has been observed by others and by us also, that
Amber, for instance, attracts more vigorously if the surface be made very
smooth than otherwise, it induces me to conjecture, that, if this Observation
about Diamonds be true, as some of my trials have now and then inclined me to
think it, and if it do not in some cases considerably depend upon the loss of
the Electrical Substance of the Stone, by its being cut and ground, the Reason
may possibly be, that the great rapidness with which the Wheels that serve to
cut and polish Diamonds must be mov'd, does excite a great degree of heat,
which the senses may easily discover in the Stone, and by that and the strong
concussion it makes of its parts, may force it to spend its effluviable matter,
if I may so call it, so plentifully, that the Stone may be impoverish'd and
perhaps also, on the account of some little change in its Texture, be rendred
lesse disposed to emit those effluvia that are Instruments of Electrical
Attraction.

Of these Opinions the First is that of the learned Jesuite Cabaeus, who,
though a Peripatetick and Commentator on Aristotle, thinks the drawing of
light Bodies by Jet, Amber, &c. may be accounted for, by supposing, that the
steams that issue, or, if I may so speak, sally, out of Amber, when heated by
rubbing, discuss and expell the neighbouring air; which after it has been
driven off a little way, makes as it were a small whirl-wind, because of the
resistance it finds from the remoter air, which has not been wrought on by the
Electrical Steams; and that these, shrinking back swiftly enough to the Amber,
do in their returns bring along with them such light bodies as they meet with
in their way. On occasion of which Hypothesis I shall offer it to be
consider'd, Whether by the gravity of the Atmospherical Air, surmounting the
Specifick Gravity of the little and rarifi'd Atmosphere, made about the Amber
by its emissions, and comprising the light Body fasten'd on by them, the
Attraction may not in divers cases be either caused or promoted.

And according to this Hypothesis, the Amber, or other Electrick, being chaf'd
or heated, is made to emit certain Rayes or Files of unctuous Steams, which,
when they come to be a little cool'd by the external air, are somewhat
condens'd, and having lost of their former agitation, shrink back to the body
whence they sallied out, and carry with them those light bodies, that their
further ends happen to adhere to, at the time of their Retraction: As when a
drop of Oyl or Syrup hangs from the end of a small stick, if that be
dextrously and cautiously struck, the viscous substance will, by that impulse,
be stretch'd out, and presently retreating, will bring along with it the dust
or other light bodies that chanced to stick to the remoter parts of it.

Learned Gassendus, who addes to it, that these Electrical Rays if they may be
so call'd being emitted several ways, and consequently crossing one another,
get into the pores of the Straw, or other light body to be attracted, and by
means of their Decussation take the faster hold of it, and have the greater

A third Hypothesis there is, which was devised by the Acute Cartesius, who
dislikes the Explications of others, chiefly because he thinks them not
applicable to Glass, which he supposes unfit to send forth Effluvia, and which
is yet an Electrical body; and therefore attempts to account for Electrical
Attractions by the intervention of certain particles, shap'd almost like small
pieces of Ribbond, which he supposes to be form'd of this subtile matter
harbour'd in the pores or crevises of Glass.

To shew that the virtue that a Loadstone hath by this determinate Pole or
Extream to attract, for example, the South-end of a poised needle, and with
the opposite extream or Pole the North-end of the same needle, I made among
other tryals the following Experiment.

Taking a very small fragment of a Loadstone, I found, agreeably to my
conjecture, that by applying sometimes one Pole, sometimes the other, to that
pole of a small but a very vigorous Loadstone that was fit for my purpose, I
could at pleasure, in a few minutes, change the Poles of the little fragment,
as I tryed by its operations upon a needle freely poised; though by applying a
fragment a pretty deal bigger, for in it self it appeared very small, I was
not able in far more hours than I employed minutes before, to make any
sensible change of the Poles.

This short Memorial being added to the preceding part of this discourse, will,
I hope, satisfie you, that how unanimously so ever men have deduced all
magnetick operations from the form of the Loadstone; yet some internal change
of pores or some other Mechanical alterations or inward disposition, either of
the excited Iron or of the Loadstone it self, may suffice to make a body
capable or uncapable of exercising some determinate magnetical operations;
which may invite you to cast a more unprejudiced eye upon those few
particulars,

&c. that, when hardened and well tempered tools are well heated by Attrition,
if whilest they are thus warmed you apply them to filings or chips, as they
call them, or thin fragments of Steel or Iron, they will take them up, as if
the instruments were touched with a Loadstone:

but as they will not do so, unless they be thus excited by rubbing till they
be warmed, by which means a greater commotion is made in the inner parts of
the Steel so neither would they retain so vigorous a Magnetism as to support
the little fragments of Steel that stuck to them after they were grown cold
again. EXPER. VI. Which may be confirmed by what, if I much misremember not, I
shewed some Acquaintances of yours; which was, that, by barely rubbing a
conveniently shaped piece of Steel against the floor till it had gained a
sufficient heat, it would whilest it continued so, discover a manifest, though

But then this virtue, displayed by the extreams of the bar of Iron, will not
be at all permanent, but so transient, that, if the bar be but inverted and
held again upright, that end which just before was the uppermost, and drew the
north-end of the needle, will now, being lowermost, drive it away, which, as
was lately observed, will not happen to a bar which has been some years or
other competent time kept in the same Position. So that, since length of time
is requisite to make the verticity of a bar of iron so durable & constant,
that the same extream will have the same virtues in reference to the
Magnetical needle, whether you make it the upper end or the lower end of the
bar, it seems not improbable to me, that by length of time the whole Magnetick
virtue of this Iron may be increased, and consequently some degree of
attraction acquired.

Therefore, when I remember the great resemblance I have sometimes seen in
colour, besides other manifest Qualities, betwixt some Loadstones and some
course or almost rusty Iron, I am tempted to Conjecture, that those that
observed this Iron-bar when broken to have acquired a strong Magnetical virtue,
which they dreamed not that tract of time might communicate to it, might

But, leaving this as a bare conjecture, we may take notice, that what virtue
an oblong piece of Iron may need a long tract of time to acquire, by the help
onely of its position, may be imparted to it in a very short time, by the
intervention of such a nimble agent, as the fire. As may be often, though not
always, observed in Tongs, and such like Iron Utensils, that, having been
ignited, have been set to cool, leaning against some wall or other prop, that
kept them in an erected posture, which makes it probable that the great
commotion of the parts, made by the vehement heat of the fire, disposed the
Iron, whilst it was yet soft, and had its pores more lax, and parts more
pliable, disposed it, I say, to receive much quicker impressions from the
Magnetical effluvia of the Earth, than it would have done, if it had still
been cold.

But a bar of Iron being ignited, and set to cool perpendicularly, does thereby
acquire a manifest verticity. Of which differing events I must not now stay to
inquire, whether or no the true reason be, That the peculiar Texture or
internal constitution that makes a Loadstone somewhat more than an ordinary
Ore of Iron, which metal, as far as I have tried, is the usual ingredient of
Loadstones being spoiled by the violence of the fire, this rude Agent leaves
it in the condition of common Iron, or perhaps of ignited Iron-ore: whereas
the fire does soften the Iron it self which is a metal not an Ore agitating
its parts, and making them the more flexible, and by relaxing its pores,
disposes it to be easily and plentifully pervaded by the Magnetical steams of
the Earth, from which it may not improbably be thought to receive the
verticity it acquires; EXPER. XI. and this the rather, because, as I have
often tryed, and elsewhere mentioned, if an oblong Loadstone, once spoil'd by
the fire, be thorowly ignited and cooled either perpendicularly, or lying
horizontally North and South, it will, as well as a piece of Iron handled
after the same manner, be made to acquire new poles, or change the old ones,
as the skilful experimenter pleases.

For in that Experiment I have shewn, how having brought a good piece of a
certain kind of English Oker, which yet perhaps was no fitter than other, to a
convenient shape, though, till it was altered by the fire, it discovered no
Magnetical Quality; yet after it had been kept red-hot in the fire and was
suffered to cool in a convenient posture, it was enabled to exercise
Magnetical operations upon a pois'd Needle.

But my stay abroad proving much longer than I expected, when, being returned
to London, I had occasion to make use of this Loadstone for an Experiment, I
found it indeed where I left it, but so exceedingly decayed, as to its
attractive power, which I had formerly examin'd by weight, by having lain
almost a year in an inconvenient posture, that if it had not been for the
circumstances newly related, I should have concluded that some body had
purposely got it out in my absence, and spoiled it by help of the fire, the
vertue being so much impaired, that I cared little to employ it any more about
considerable Experiments.

it pertinent in this place, and to induce me to think, it might yet better
succeed with him, whose Experiment, as far as it concerns my present purpose,
imports, that if a Puncheon, as Smiths call it, or a Rod of Iron, be, by being
ignited and suffered to cool North and South, and hammered at the ends, very

dissolved in some Acid Menstruums, yet I have found upon tryals, which my

Strong and Cleer Lixivium of Potashes, and much more of some other
Praecipitating liquors that I sometimes employ, afford good store of a Crudled

Abject Servant to his Brethren, which accordingly did in part come to pass,
when the Israelites of the posterity of Sem, subdued the Canaanites, that
descended from Cham, and kept them in great Subjection.

And this recalls into my Memory, what a very Ingenious Physician has divers
times related to me of a young Lady, to whom being call'd, he found that
though she much complain'd of want of Health, yet there appear'd so little
cause either in her Body, or her Condition to Guess that She did any more than
fancy her self Sick, that scrupling to give her Physick, he perswaded her
friends rather to divert her Mind by little journeys of Pleasure, in one of
which going to Visit St. Winifrids Well, this Lady, who was a Catholick, and
devout in her Religion, and a pretty while in the VVater to perform some
Devotions, $had occasion to fix her Eyes very attentively upon the Red
pipple-stones, which in a scatter'd order made up a good part of those that
appear'd through the water,

Sparks are the slivers or chips of the Iron vitrified, Others are only the
slivers melted into Balls without vitrification, And the third kind are only
small slivers of the Iron, made red-hot with the violence of the stroke given

doubt not, find cause to believe, that the reason I have heretofore given of
it, is the true and genuine cause of it, namely, That the Spark appearing so
bright in the falling, is nothing else but a small piece of the Steel or Flint,
but most commonly of the Steel, which by the violence of the stroke is at the
same time sever'd and heatt red-hot, and that sometimes to such a degree, as
to make it melt together into a small Globule of steel;

and shaking together all the filings that had fallen upon the sheet of Paper
underneath, and observing them with the Microscope, I found a great number of
small Globules, such as the former, though there were also many of the parts
that had remained untoucht, and rough filings or chips of Iron. So that, it
seems, Iron does contain a very combustible sulphureous Body, which is, in all
likelihood, one of the causes of this Phaenomenon, and which may be perhaps
very much concerned in the business of its hardening and tempering: of which
somewhat is said in the Description of Muscovy-glass. So that, these things
considered, we need not trouble our selves to find out what kind of Pores they
are, both in the Flint and Steel, that contain the Atoms of fire, nor how
those Atoms come to be hindred from running all out, when a dore or passage in
their Pores is made by the concussion:

And this Phaenomenon, as I have elsewhere more largely shewn, proceeds from a
propriety which belongs to all kinds of fluid Bodies more or less, and is
caused by the Incongruity of the Ambient and included Fluid, which so acts and
modulates each other, that they acquire, as neer as is possible, a sperical or
globular form, which propriety and several of the Phaenomena that proceed from
it, I have more fully explicated in the sixth Observation.

Next, it seem'd nothing more difficult to give an intelligible reason, why
Cork is a body so very unapt to suck and drink in Water, and consequently
preserves it self, floating on the top of Water, though left on it never so

very much condens'd and consequently presses very strongly to get a passage

And thirdly, if we enquire why Cork has such a springiness and swelling nature
$when compress'd? and how it comes to suffer so great a compression, or
seeming penetration of dimensions, so as to be made a substance as heavie
again and more, bulk for bulk, as it was before compression, and yet suffer'd
to return, is found to extend it self again into the same space? Our
Microscope will easily inform us, that the whole mass consists of an infinite
company of small Boxes or Bladders of Air, which is a substance of a springy
nature, and that will suffer a considerable condensation as I have several
times found by divers trials, by which I have most evidently condens'd it into
less then a twentieth part of its usual dimensions neer the Earth, and that
with no other strength then that of my hands without any kind of forcing
Engine, such as Racks, Leavers, Wheels, Pullies, or the like, but this onely

springiness, and toughness of some, both as to their flexibility and
restitution. What, of the friability or brittleness of some others, and the

And having enquir'd into the History of Cork, I find it reckoned as an
excrescency of the bark of a certain Tree, which is distinct from the two
barks that lie within it, which are common also to other trees; That $'t $is
some time before the Cork that covers the young and tender sprouts comes to be
discernable; That it cracks, flaws, and cleaves into many great chaps, the
bark underneath remaining entire; That it may be separated and remov'd from
the Tree, and yet the two under-barks such as are also common to that with
other Trees not at all injur'd, but rather helped and freed from an external
injury.

Elder, or almost any other Tree, the inner pulp or pith of the Cany hollow
stalks of several other Vegetables: as of Fennel, Carrets, Daucus, Bur-docks,
Teafels, Fearn, some kinds of Reeds, &c. have much such a kind of Schematisme,
as I have lately shewn that of Cork, save onely that here the pores are rang'd
the long-ways, or the same ways with the length of the Cane, whereas in Cork

Quil, has much such a kind of texture, save onely that which way soever I set
this light substance, the pores seem'd to be cut transversly; so that I ghess
this pith which fills the Feather, not to consist of abundance of long pores
separated with Diaphragms, as Cork does, but to be a kind of solid or hardned
froth, or a congeries of very small bubbles consolidated in that form, into a
pretty stiff as well as tough concrete, and that each Cavern, Bubble, or Cell,
is distinctly separate from any of the rest, without any kind of hole in the
encompassing films, so that I could no more blow through a piece of this kinde

Now, though I have with great diligence endeavoured to find whether there be
any such thing in those Microscopical pores of Wood or Piths, as the Valves in
the heart, veins, and other passages of Animals, that open, and give passage
to the contain'd fluid juices one way, and shut themselves, and impede the
passage of such liquors back again, yet have I not hitherto been able to say
any thing positive in it; though, me thinks, it seems very probable, that
Nature has in these passages, as well as in those of Animal bodies, very many
appropriated Instruments and contrivances, whereby to bring her designs and
end to pass, which $'t $is not improbable, but that some diligent Observer, if
help'd with better Microscopes, may in time detect.

And that this may be so, seems with great probability to be argued from the
strange Phaenomena of sensitive Plants, wherein Nature seems to perform
several Animal actions with the same Schematism or Orginization that is common
to all Vegetables, as may appear by some no less instructive then curious
Observations that were made by divers Eminent Members of the Royal Society on
some of these kind of Plants, whereof an account was delivered in to them by
the most Ingenious and Excellent Physician, Doctor Clark, which, having that
liberty granted me by that most Illustrious Society, I have hereunto adjoyn'd.

It is not my design at present, to examine the use and Mechanisme of these
parts of Wood, that being more proper to another Enquiry; but rather to hint,
that from this Experiment we may learn, First, what is the cause of the
blackness of many burnt bodies, which we may find to be nothing else but this;
that the heat of the fire agitating and rarifying the waterish, transparent,
and volatile water that is contain'd in them, by the continuation of that
action, does so totally expel and drive away all that which before fill'd the
pores, and was dispers'd also through the solid mass of it, and thereby caus'd
an universal kind of transparency, that it not onely leaves all the pores
empty, but all the Interstitia also so dry and opacous, and perhaps also yet
further perforated, that the light onely is reflected back which falls upon
the very outward edges of the pores, all they that enter into the pores of the

In the mean time, before I finish this Discourse, I must not forget to
acquaint the Reader, that having had the liberty granted me of making some
trials on a piece of Lignum fossile shewn to the Royal Society, by the
eminently Ingenious and Learned Physician, Doctor Ent, who receiv'd it for a
Present from the famous Ingenioso Cavalliero de Pozzi, it being one of the
fairest and best pieces of Lignum fossile he had seen; Having I say taken a
small piece of this Wood, and examin'd it, I found it to burn in the open Air
almost like other Wood,

after the manner I above prescrib'd, I found it infinitely to abound with the

And therefore, what ever is by some, who have written of it, and particularly
by Francisco Stelluto, who wrote a Treatise in Italian of that Subject, which
was Printed at Rome, 1637, affirm'd that it is a certain kind of Clay or Earth,
which in tract of time is turn'd into Wood, I rather suspect the quite
contrary, that it was at first certain great Trees of Fir or Pine, which by
some Earthquake, or other casualty, came to be buried under the Earth, and was
there, after a long time's residence according to the several natures of the
encompassing adjacent parts either rotted and turn'd into a kind of Clay,
petrify'd and turn'd into a kind of Stone, or else had its pores fill'd with
certain Mineral juices, which being stayd in time, and in tract of time
coagulated, appear'd, upon cleaving out, like small Metaline Wires, or else
from some flames or scorching forms that are the occasion oftentimes, and
usually accompany Earthquakes, might be blasted and turn'd into Coal, or else
from certain subterraneous fires which are affirm'd by that Authour to abound
much about those parts namely, in a Province of Italy, call'd Umbria, now the
Dutchie of Spoletto, in the Territory of Todi, anciently call'd Tudor, and
between the two Villages of Collesecco and Rosaro not far distant from the
high-way leading to Rome, where it is found in greater quantity then elsewhere
are by reason of their being encompassed with Earth, and so kept close from
the dissolving Air, charr'd and converted into Coal.

and with a Microscope, I found that all those Microscopical pores, which in
sappy or firm and sound Wood are fill'd with the natural or innate juices of
those Vegetables, in this they were all empty, like those of Vegetables
charr'd; but with this difference, that they seem'd much larger then I have
seen any in Char-coals; nay, even then those of Coals made of great blocks of
Timber, which are commonly call'd Old-coals. The reason of which difference
may probably be, that the charring of Vegatables, being an operation quickly
performed, and whilest the Wood is sappy, the more solid parts may more easily
shrink together, and contract the pores or interstitia between them, then in
the rotten Wood, where that natural juice seems onely to be wash'd away by
adventitious or unnatural moisture;

The Reasons of all which Phaenomena seem to be, That this petrify'd Wood
having lain in some place where it was well soak'd with petrifying water that
is, such a water as is well impregnated with stony and earthy particles did by
degrees separate, either by straining and filtration, or perhaps, by
precipitation, cohesion or coagulation, abundance of stony particles from the
permeating water, which stony particles, being by means of the fluid vehicle
convey'd, not onely into the Microscopical pores, and so perfectly stoping
them up, but also into the pores or interstitia, which may, perhaps, be even
in the texture or Schematisme of that part of the Wood, which through the
Microscope, appears most solid, do thereby so augment the weight of the Wood,
as to make it above three times heavier then water, and perhaps, six times as
heavie as it was when Wood.

From all which, and several other particulars which I oberv'd, I $can $not but
think, that all these, and most other kinds of stony bodies which are found
thus strangely figured, do owe their formation and figuration, not to any kind
of Plastick virtue inherent in the earth, but to the Shells of certain
Shel-fishes, which, either by some Deluge, Inundation, Earthquake, or some
such other means, came to be thrown to that place, and there to be fill'd with
some kind of Mudd or Clay, or petrifying Water, or some other substance, which
in tract of time has been settled together and hardned in those shelly moulds
into those shaped substances we now find them; that the great and thin end of
these Shells by that Earthquake, or what ever other extraordinay cause it was
that brought them thither, was broken off; and that many others were otherwise
broken, bruised and disfigured; that these Shells which are thus spirallied
and separated with Diaphragmes, were some kind of Nautili or Porcelane shelle;
and that others were shells of Cockles, Muscles, Periwincles, Scolops, &c. of
various sorts; that these Shelles in many, from the particular nature of the
containing or enclos'd Earth, or some other cause, have in tract of time
rotted and mouldred away, and onely left their impressionss, both on the
containing and contained substances; and so left them pretty loose one within
another, so that they may be easily separated by a knock or two of a Hammer.
That other of these Shells, according to the nature of the substance adjacent
to them, have, by a long continuance in that posture, been petrify'd and
turn'd into the nature of stone, just as I even now observ'd several sorts of
Wood to be. That oftentimes the Shell may be found with one kind of substance
within, and quite another without, having, perhaps, been fill'd in one place,
and afterwards translated to another, which I have very frequently observ'd in
Cockle, Muscle, Periwincle, and other shells, which I have found by the Sea
side.

And though these fibres appear not through a Microscope, exactly jointed and
contex'd, as in Sponge; yet, as I formerly hinted, I am apt to think, that
could we find some way of discovering the texture of it, whil'st it invests
the living Animal, or had some very easie way of separating the pulp or
intercurrent juices, such as in all probability fill those Interstitia,
without dilacerating, brusing, or otherwise spoiling the texture of it as it
seems to be very much by the ways of tanning and dressing now us'd we might
discover a much more curious texture then I have hitherto been able to find;
perhaps, somewhat like that of Sponges.

The crooks, I suppose also to be the cause why these angry creatures, hastily
removing themselves from their revenge, do often leave these weapons behind
them, sheath'd, as $'t $were, in the flesh, and, by that means, cause the
painfull symptoms to be greater, and more lasting, which are very probably
caus'd, partly by the piercing and tearing of the skin by the Sting, but
chiefly by the corrosive and poisonous liquor that is by this Syringe-pipe
convey'd among the sensitive parts thereof and thereby more easily gnaws and
corrodes those tender fibres: As I have shewed in the description of a Nettle
