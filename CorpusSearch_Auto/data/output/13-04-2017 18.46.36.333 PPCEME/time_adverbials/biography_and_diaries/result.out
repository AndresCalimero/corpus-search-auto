which brought him so near death before I first knew him, when his Spirits were
so low and spent, that he could not move nor stir, and he did not think to
live an hour; He said, His Reason and Judgment were so clear and strong, that
from thence he was fully perswaded that Death was not the spending or

For Morality, he freely own'd to me, that though he talked of it, as a fine
thing, yet this was only because he thought it a decent way of speaking, and
that as they went always in Cloaths, though in their Frollicks they would have
chosen sometimes to have gone naked, if they had not feared the people: So
though some of them found it necessary for humane life to talk of Morality,
yet he confessed they cared not for it, further than the reputation of it was
necessary for their credit, and affairs: of which he gave me many Instances,
as their professing and swearing Friendship, where they hated mortally; their
Oaths and Imprecations in their Addresses to Women, which they intended never
to make good; the pleasure they took in defaming innocent Persons, and
spreading false Reports of some, perhaps in Revenge, because they could not
enage them to comply with their ill Designs: The delight they had in making
people quarrel; their unjust usage of their Creditors, and putting them off by
any deceitful Promise they could invent, that might deliver them from present
Importunity. So that in detestation of these Courses he would often break
forth into such hard Expressions concerning himself as would be indecent for
another to repeat.

But to this I answered, That as it were unreasonable to tell a man that is
abroad, and knows he is awake, that perhaps he is in a dream, and in his Bed,
and only thinks he is abroad, or that as some go about in their sleep, so he
may be asleep still: So good and religious men know, though others may be
abused, by their fancies, that they are under no such deception: and find they
are neither hot nor Enthusiastical, but under the power of calm and clear
Principles.

There might be as many hard Arguments brought against the possibility of these
things, which yet every one knows to be true, from Speculative Notions, as
against the Mysteries mentioned in the Scriptures. As that of the Trinity,
That in one Essence there are three different Principles of Operation, which,
for want of terms fit to express them by, We call Persons, and are called in
Scripture The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that the Second of these did
unite Himself in a most intimate manner with the Humane Nature of Jesus Christ:
And that the Sufferings he underwent, were accepted of God as a Sacrifice for
our Sins; Who thereupon conferred on Him a Power of granting Eternal Life to
all that submit to the Terms on which He offers it; And that the matter of
which our Bodies once consisted, which may be as justly called the Bodies we
laid down at our Deaths, as these can be said to be the Bodies which We
formerly lived in, being refined and made more spiritual, shall be reunited to
our Souls, and become a fit Instrument for them in a more perfect Estate: And
that God inwardly bends and moves our Wills, by such Impressions, as he can
make on our Bodies and Minds.

bring us often under as great straights. So that it ought to be no just
prejudice, that there are some things in Religion that are uneasie, since this
is rather the effect of our corrupt Natures, which are farther deprav'd by
vitious habits, and can hardly turn to any new course of life, without some
pain, than of the Dictates of Christianity, which are in themselves just and
reasonable, and will be easie to us when renew'd, and a good measure restor'd

He told me, He saw Vice and Impiety were as contrary to Humane Society, as
wild Beasts let loose would be; and therefore he firmly resolved to change the
whole method of his Life: to become strictly just and true, to be Chast and
Temperate, to forbear Swearing and Irreligious Discourse, to Worship and Pray
to his Maker: And that though he was not arrived at a full perswasion of
Christianity, he would never employ his Wit more to run it down, or to corrupt
others. Of which I have since a further assurance, from a Person of Quality,
who conversed much with him, the last year of his life; to whom he would often
say, That he was happy, if he did believe, and that he would never endeavour
to draw him from it.

I went after all publique devotions were finish'd to visite the Bishop of St.
Asaph the Queens Almoner who was now entered upon the sole Regal Government
during her husbands Absence where was the Bishops of Lond. & Worcester & Deane
of Paules Dr Tenison &c: all of them not a little surpriz'd at what had
happned in Savoy, among the Voudois, who being so neere their destruction &
final extirpation by the French, as that they were generaly given up as to
slaughter, & that every body expected to heare of their calamities & final
destruction: It pleased God $that the Duke of Savoy hitherto joyning with the
French in persecution of those poore Christians, & now pressed by the French
to deliver $Verrue & Turin as Cautionary to the French, upon their suspicion
that he might at last come into the German Princes Confederacy having
seacretly concerted with the Confederats, & adjusted the Condition &c, not
onely declared for the Confederats, but invited those poore Christians from
their dispersions & Latebrae among the Mountain whither they had fled; but
restor'd them to their Country, Dwellings, Exercise of the Religion, beged
pardon for the ill usage they had received, & charging it upon the cruelty of
the French, who forced him to it &c: These being the Remainder of those
persecuted Christians, $whom the Bishop had so long time, affirmed to be the 2
Wittnesses spoken of in the Revelation who should be Kild, & brought to life
againe;

I went afterwards with him to visite Mr. Boyle & Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explaind the necessity of its so falling out by the Scriptures in a

$should begin the Milennium, not as himselfe $personally reigning in Earth
Visibly; but that the true Religion & universal peace, should obtaine thro all

did declare that there was no law against taking the oath of children above

boys had given of their understanding the nature and consequence of an oath,
and now my own observation of the sobriety and readiness of their answers,
further then of any man of any rank that came to give witness this day, though
some men of years and learning, I was a little amazed, and fully satisfied

seperated from all mutuall Societie if not driven into Discord and Disention,

Contention betwixt Men of best Callinge and Condition; wherof if the better

For Cardinall Wolsey, a man very ambitious, and desirous as good hope and
likelyhod he had to aspire vnto that dignity, perceaving himself of his
expectacion disapointed, by meanes of the Emperour $Chareles so highely
comendinge one Cardinall Adrian, sometyme his scholemaster, to the Cardinalls
of Roome, in the tyme of their election, for his vertue and worthines, that
therevppon was he chosen Pope; who from Spayne, where he was then resident,
cominge on foote to Roome, before his entry into the Citye, did put of his
hosen and showes, barefoote and barlegged passing throwe the streates towards
his pallaice, with such humblenes that all the people had him in greate
reuerence; Cardinall Wolsey, I say, waxed so wood therwith, that he studied to
invent all waies of reuengment of his grief against the Emperour; which, as it
was the begininge of a lamentable tragedye, so some parte of it as not
impertinent to my present purpose, I recknid requisite here to put in
remembraunce.

And therevppon caused he one master Crooke, cheif of the six clerks, to make a
docket contayning the whole number and causes of all such Iniunctions as
either in his tyme had alredy passed, or at that present depended in any of
the kings Courtes at westminster before him. Which done, he invited all the
Judges to dyne with him in the councell chamber at westminster: where, after
dynner, when he had broken with them what complaintes he had heard of his
Iniunctions, and moreouer shewed them bothe the number and causes of euery one
of them, in order, so plainely that, vppon full debating of thos matters, they
were all inforced to confes that they, in like case, could haue done no other
wise themselfes, Then offred he this vnto them: that if the Iustices of euery
courte vnto whom the reformacion of the rigour of the lawe, by reason of their
office, most especially appertained wold, vppon resonable considerations, by
their owne discretions as they were, as he thought, in consciens bound
mitigate and reforme the rigour of the lawe themselves, there should from
thenceforth by him no more Iniunctions be graunted. Wherunto when they refused
to condiscend, then said he vnto them: "Forasmuch as your selves, my lordes,
drive me to that necessity for awardinge out Iniunctions to releive the
peoples iniury, you $can $not hereafter any more justly blame me."

And as litle leysure as he had to be occupied in the study of holy scripture
and controuersies vppon religion and such other vertuous exercises, being in
manner contynually busied about thaffaires of the kinge and the realme, yeat
such watche and payne in setting forth of divers profitable workes, in defens
of the true $Christian religion, against hereseies secreatly sowen abrode in
the Realme, assuredly sustayned he, that the Byshoppes, to whose pastorall
cure $the $reformacione thereof principally appertained, thinking themselfes
by his travaile, wherein by their owne confession they were not able with him
to make comparison, of their duties in that behalf discharged, And considering
that for all his princes favour he was no rich man, nor in yearly revenues
advaunced as his worthines deserved; Therefore, at a convocation among
themselfes and other of the clergie, they agreed together and concluded vppon
a some of foure or five thowsand poundes, at the least, to my remembraunce,
for his paynes to recompence him. To the payment whereof euery Byshop, Abbott,
and the rest of the Clergye were, after the rate $of $their $abillityes,
liberall contributories, hoping this porcion should be to his contentation.
Whervppon Tunstall, Bishopp of Dirham, Clark, Bishopp of Bath, and, as farr as
I can call to mind, Vaysey, Bishop of Exeter, repayred vnto him, declaring
howe thanckfully for his travailes, to their discharge, in godes cause
bestowed, they reckned themselves bounden to consider him; And that albeit
they could not, according to his desertes, so worthily as they gladly wold,
requite him therefore, but must reserve that only to the goodnes of god, yeat
for a small parte of recompense, in respecte of his estate so vnequall to his
worthines, in the name of their whole convocacion, they presented vnto him
that some, which they desired him to take in good parte. Who, forsaking it,
said, That like as it was no small comforte vnto him that so wise and learned
men so well accepted his simple doings, for which he never intended to receiue
reward but at thands of god onlye, to whom alone was the thanck thereof
cheefly to be ascribed, So gaue he most hvmble thanckes to their honours all
for their $so bountiffull $and $freindly consideration.

Fisher, to be man of notable vertuos livinge and learninge, repaired to
Rochester, and there disclosed to him all her revelacions, desiring his advise
and councell therein; which the Bishoppe perceyvinge might well stand with the

This Sir Thomas Moore, amonge all other his vertues, was of suche meeknes that
if it had fortuned him with any learned men resortinge to him from Oxford,
Cambridge, or els where, as there did divers, some for desire of his
acquaintaunce, some for the famous reporte of his wisdome and learning, and
some for suites of the vniuersityes, to haue entered into argvment, wherein
fewe were comparable vnto him, and so farre to have discoursed with them
therein that he might perceiue they coulde not, without some inconveiens, hold
out much further disputacion against him: Then, least he should discomforte
them, as he that sought out not his owne glory, but rather wold seeme
conquered then to discourage studentes in their studies, euer shewinge himself
more desirous to learne then to teache, wold he by some witty devise
courteouslye breake of into some other matter, and geeve over. Of whom, for
his wisdome and learninge, had the kinge suche an opinion, that at suche tyme
as he attended vppon his highnes, takinge his progresse either to oxford or
Cambridge, where he was receaved with very eloquent orations, his grace wold
alwaies assigne him, as one that was prompte and ready therein, ex tempore to
make awneswer therevnto. Whose manner was, whensoeuer he had occasion, either
here or beyond the sea, to be in any vniuersity, not onely to be present at
the readinge and $disputations there comonly vsed, but also learnedly to
dispute amonge them himself. Who, beinge Chauncelour of the duchie, was made
Embassador twice, ioyned in Comission with Cardinall Wolsey, once to $the
Emperour Charels into Flaunders, the other tyme to the French kinge into

it seemed, a manifest miraculous token of his speciall favour towardes him, at
such tyme as my wife, as many other that yeare were, was sick of the sweating
sicknes; who, lieing in $so great extremity of that disease as by no invention
or devises that phisitions in such $cases comonly vse of whom she had diuers
both experte, wise and wel learned, then continually attendant about her she
could be kepte from sleape, So that both phisitions and all other there
dispaired of her recouerye, and gave her ouer; her father, as he that most
intirely tendred her, being in no small hevines for her, by praier at gods
hand sought to get her remedy. Whervppon goinge vppe, after his vsuall maner,
into his foresaid newe buildinge, there in his Chappell, vppon his knees, with
teares most devoutly besought allmighty god that it wold like his goodnes,
vnto whom nothinge was impossible, if it were his blessed will, at his
mediation to voutchsafe gratiously to heare his $humble petition. Where
incontynent came into his mynd that a glister shold be thonly way to helpe her.
Which, when he told the phisitions, they by and by confessed that, if there
were any hope of health, that was the very best helpe indead, much marvailinge
of themselfes that they had not before remembred it.

As Sir Thomas Moore in the Tower chaunced on a tyme, lookinge out of his
windowe, to behold one master Reynolds, a religious, learned, and vertuous
father of Sion, and three Monkes of the Charterhouse, for the Matters of the
Matrimonye and Supremacye goinge out of the Tower to execution, He, as one
longinge in that iourneye to haue accompanied them, said vnto my wife, then
standinge there besides him: "Loe, doest thow not see, Megge, that thes
blessed fathers be nowe as chearefully goinge to their deathes as bridegromes
to their Mariage? Wherefore thereby maiste thow see, myne owne good daughter,
what a greate difference there is betweene such as haue in effecte spent all
their dayes in a straight, hard, penetentiall, and paynefull life religiously,
and such as haue in the world, like worldly wretches, as thy poore father
$hath done, consumed all theyr tyme in pleasure and ease licentiouslye.
