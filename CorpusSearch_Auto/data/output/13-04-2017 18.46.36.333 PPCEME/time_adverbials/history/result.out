When they were come, and had setled themselves to attentione, Doctor Heath,
Archbishop of Yorke, and Lord Chauncelor of England, with a composed
countenance and voice, as neither glad at the death of the old Prince, nor
discontended at the new, declared to them the assured advertisement of the
death of the Queene: That albeit the Parliament by this heavy accident did
dissolve, yet for that they had bin elected to represent the common people of
the Realme, and to deale for them in matters of estate, they could noe waye
better dischardge that trust, then in joyninge with the Lords to publish the
next Successour to the Crowne: That the right and title of Lady Elizabeth,
sister to the deceased Queene, and onely daughter then surviving of King Henry
the Eighth, was esteemed by the Lords free from all quarrell, free from all
questione and doubt: that in no case expeditione is more expedient, than in
these high passages of State, for extinguishing as well the vayne hopes of
enemyes, as the false and needelesse feares of friendes: that for this cause
the Lords had desired their presence, that, with joynt consent of the whole
assembly, the Lady Elizabeth might forthwith be proclaymed Queene.

establish'd by succession, finding thir power arrive well nigh at the utmost

Which quickly bred among them, either envy, or mutual jealousies; till the

watching and praying, appear'd to him, and to make the Vision more sensible,
gave him many stripes for offering to desert his flock; at sight whereof the

While Cuthred the West-Saxon had a fight with Ethelhun, one of his Nobles, a
stout Warrier, envi'd by him in some matter of the Common-wealth, as far as by
the Latin of Ethelwerd can be understood others interpret it Sedition and with
much ado overcoming, took Ethelhun for his valour into favour, by whom
faithfully serv'd in the twelf or thirteenth of his Reign, he encounter'd in a
set Battell with Ethelbald the Mercian at Beorford, now Burford in Oxfordshire;
one year after against the Welch, which was the last but one of his life.
