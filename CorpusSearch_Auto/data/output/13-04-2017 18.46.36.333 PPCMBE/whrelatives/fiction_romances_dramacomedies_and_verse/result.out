I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale, curved lips, he led
me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me his tapestries, his
enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me wonder at the strange
loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and then told me that luxury was
nothing but a background, a painted scene in a play, and that power, power
over other men, power over the world, was the one thing worth having, the one
supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy one never tired of, and that in
our century only the rich possessed it.

Goring - Lord Goring: Of which I know nothing by experience, though I know
