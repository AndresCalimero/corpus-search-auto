this strange and wonderful way, which gives to man a history - and such a
history - as to what there is in those veins, in those rocks, the ores, the
water springs, the atmosphere around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of forces in one great mass, 8000 miles in diameter,
that the mind is overwhelmed in contemplation of the wonderful history related

I shall, therefore, digest, in the best manner I can, the three first
publications of Dr. Franklin, entitled New Experiments and Observations on
Electricity, made at Philadelphia in America, communicated in several letters
to Peter Collinson Esq. of London, fellow of the Royal Society; the first of
which is dated July 28th. 1747, and the last April 18th. 1754.

Though the English have not been backward in acknowledging the great merit of
this philosopher, he has had the singular good fortune to be, perhaps, even
more celebrated abroad than at home; so that to form a just idea of the great
and deserved reputation of Dr. Franklin, we must read the foreign publications
on the subject of electricity; in many of which the terms Franklinism,
Franklinist, and the Franklinian system occur in almost every page.

He had observed, that if two persons stood upon wax, one of which rubbed the
tube, and the other took the fire from it, they would both appear to be
electrified; that if they touched one another after that operation, a stronger
spark would be perceived between them, than when any other person touched
either of them; and that such a spark would take away the electricity of both.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.
