politeness of foreigners who are vested with a supreme command shewn to such
officers of different nations who occasionally touch at the several ports
where they preside, or that does more honor to the power by whom they are
employed, it would be singular injustice not to mention the very great
character given the Dutch Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, by the Captains
of the British ships, on their voyages round the world, performed in the reign
