About the Year 1717, a young Actress, of a desirable Person, sitting in an
upper Box at the Opera, a military Gentleman thought this a proper Opportunity
to secure a little Conversation with her; the Particulars of which were
probably no more worth repeating than it seems the Damoiselle then thought
them worth listening to;

That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

of Colonel Gardiner will invite many of our Officers and Soldiers, to whom his
Name has long been honourable and dear, to peruse this Account of him with
some peculiar Attention: In Consequence of which, it may be a Means of
increasing the Number, and brightening the Character, of those who are already
adorning their Office, their Country, and their Religion; and of reclaiming
those who will see rather what they ought to be, than what they are.

Her Second Son, the worthy Person of whom I am now to give a more particular
Account, was born at Carriden, in Linlithgow-Shire, on the 10th of January,
A.D. 1687-8, the memorable Year of that glorious Revolution which he justly
esteem'd among the happiest of all Events. So that, when he was slain in the
Defence of those Liberties, which God then by so gracious a Providence rescued
from utter Destruction, i.e. on the 21st of September 1745, he was aged 57
Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days.

upon him, when, in the Beginning of the Year 1715, he intrusted him with the
important Dispatches, relating to a Discovery, which by a Series of admirable
Policy he had made, of a Design which the French King was then forming, for

apprehended they were so sure of Success, that it seemed a Point of Friendship
in one of the chief Counsellors of that Court, to dissuade a Dependent of his
from accepting some Employment under his Britannick Majesty, when proposed by
his Envoy there; because it was said, that in less than Six Weeks there would
be a Revolution, in favour of what they called the Family of the Stewarts.

Conversion; which I $can $not enter upon without assuring my Reader, that I
have sometimes been tempted to suppress many Circumstances of it; not only as
they may seem incredible to some, and enthusiastical to others; but I am very
sensible they are liable to great Abuses; which was the Reason that he gave me
for concealing the most extraordinary from many Persons, to whom he mentioned
some of the rest.

to both the Cases, as it stands in Page 263. of the First Edition, and Page

Experience in Human Affairs, who, after having outgrown all the Impressions of
a Religious Education; after having been hardned, rather than subdued, by the
most singular Mercies, even various, repeated, and astonishing Deliverances,
which have appeared to themselves as no less than miraculous; after having
lived for Years without God in the world, notoriously corrupt themselves, and
labouring to the utmost to corrupt others, have been stopt on a sudden in the
full Career of their Sin, and have felt such Rays of the Divine Presence, and
of Redeeming Love, darting in upon their Minds, almost like Lightning from
Heaven, as have at once rouzed, over-powered, and transformed them: So that
they have come out of their Secret Chambers with an irreconcilable Enmity to

Nevertheless, he had such a Sense of the Evil of Sin, of the Goodness of the
Divine Being, and of the admirable Tendency of the Christian revelation, that
he resolved to spend the Remainder of his Life, while God continued him out of
Hell, in as rational and as useful a Manner as he could; and to continue
casting himself at the Feet of Divine Mercy, every day, and often in a day, if

And indeed, when I consider how habitual all those criminal Indulgences were
grown to him, and that he was now in the Prime of Life, and all this while in
high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very
Constitution, that he was used strangely to think, and to say, that
Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and
giving him another.

butler and other servants, all in form; company of the first order having been

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

We decided to drop Greek entirely in the three lowest classes, with a view of
getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.
