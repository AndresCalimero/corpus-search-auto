Whereas an act, passed in the last session of parliament, intituled, An act
for the relief of certain insolvent debtors, did not contain provision
adequate to the relief of all the persons to whom it was meant to extend, by
reason that several prisoners who were in custody on the first day of January
one thousand eight hundred and four, and had continued in custody from that
time to the time of the passing of the said act, and also until and at the
time of the making out of the lists, by the said act directed to be made,
during the time of such their imprisonment, $had been removed by writ of
Habeas Corpus, or by other means from one prison to another, after the said
first day of January one thousand eight hundred and four, and before the
making out of such lists; and also because the form of the lists by that act
required to be made and delivered by the several gaolers or keepers of prisons
within this kingdom, and the form of the oath by them severally in and by the
same act required to be taken, do not comprehend and apply to the case of
prisoners so removed as herein-before mentioned:

pounds per centum per annum, to which any persons or bodies politick or
coprorate may become entitled by virtue of this act, shall be added to the
joint stock of annnuities transferable at the bank of England, which, by an
act, made in the twenty-third year of the reign of his late Majesty, were
reduced from four pounds per centum per annum to three pounds per centum per

nevertheless to redemption by parliament, in such manner and upon such notice
as in the several acts by which the said annuities, after the rate of four
pounds per centum per annum were respectively granted, are directed in respect
of the annuities redeemable by virtue thereof; and that all persons and

become entitled as aforesaid by virtue of this act, shall have and be deemed
