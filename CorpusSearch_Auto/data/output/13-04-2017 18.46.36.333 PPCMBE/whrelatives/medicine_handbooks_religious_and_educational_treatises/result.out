Chancellor of the Exchequer for Ireland, on Education for the Poor in that
Country: sold by Darton and Harvey, London: a tract I wish to recommend to the

names to the respective parts, when discoursing about so useful an animal, and
to understand others when they shall make use of the same. I next proceed to
pourtray the properties of a good horse, a knowledge of which is of the
greatest importance to young speculators in an article, where a well informed
judgment is absolutely necessary to guard against imposition, and insure

and as colds are generally the forerunners of most disorders, I shall begin
with observations on Colds and Coughs: in doing which, it will be proper to
remark, that by the wonderful mechanism of nature, in the formation of animals,
innumerable pipes and vessels are contrived, as so many canals, through which
the blood and humours constantly circulate, when the animal is in a perfect
state of health, and that numberless exceeding fine particles are continually
flying off from the surface of such bodies, either in the form of vapour, or
that of a fluid.

by which the blood or humours are driven to the surface of the body of any

old and new, fixed and moveable, may be made the subjects of exposition in
lectures, practical teaching is applicable only to a limited range of subjects;
- those, namely, in which principles having clear evidence and stable
certainty, form the basis of our knowledge; and in which, consequently, a
distinct possession of the fundamental ideas enables a student to proceed to
their applications, and to acquire the habit of applying them in every case
with ease and rapidity.

This idea, too, has now been communicated to persons of education in general,
as the general reception of the Newtonian theory of the universe proves; while,
at the same time, the very indistinct views which men of considerable
cultivation often entertain of the mechanism of the universe, proves that the
fundamental ideas on which a clear apprehension of the doctrine of universal
attraction depends, have hitherto been very imperfectly diffused through the
