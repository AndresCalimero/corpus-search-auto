In the mean time, the Persian Fleet arriv'd at Aphetae, where discovering the
Smallness of the Grecian Fleet, which lay at Artemisium, the Persian Admirals
resolv'd to engage them; wherefore imagining, that the Grecians would
immediately fly at the first Motion of their Fleet, they sent 200 Sail,
ordering them to leave the Island Sciathus on their right, and launch into the
open Sea, lest, if they cruis'd too near Euboea, they should be seen by the
Enemy: And as soon as they pass'd Geraestus and Caphareus, lying upon the
extreme parts of Euboea, near the Mouth of the Straits, to sail up the River
Euripus, and fall upon the Grecians behind, while the rest of the Fleet, which
lay at Aphetae, attack'd them before, by which means they hop'd to destroy the
whole Grecian Fleet.

Themistocles made many Remonstrances against this Resolution, first in private
to Eurybiades, telling him that the same Fear which made them forsake the
Coasts of Greece, upon which they then lay at Anchor, would afterwards also
make them divide the Fleet, and every one of the Confederates withdraw
themselves to the Defence of their own City.

And if we consider, that she had for Enemies, France and Spain, the Pope, and
all the Catholick Powers, who deny'd her Title; that the Queen of Scotland was
supported by all those Powers, in her Pretensions to her Crown; that her own
Roman-Catholick Subjects wish'd to have her dethroned, and were often in Plots
for that Purpose, in which they were encourag'd by foreign Powers, that the
Irish, who were strongly attach'd to the Pope, were rebellious, and occasion'd
many intestine Commotions in that Kingdom: And yet that in the Midst of all
she, without any Allies, supported herself thro' a long and glorious Reign:
defeated all the Projects of her Enemies, and kept the Crown unshaken on her
Head to the last, purely by her good Policy, and the Affection, Zeal and
Loyalty of her faithful Subjects, whom by her wise Behaviour she attach'd
firmly to her Interest: I say, if we consider all these Things, her vast and
surprizing Abilities will evidently appear.
