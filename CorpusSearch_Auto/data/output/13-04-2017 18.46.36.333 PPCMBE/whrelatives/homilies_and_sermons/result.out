Now concerning the manner of the divine Call it may be remarked: that in
proportion to the notoriety of the Call, or the extraordinary circumstances,
by which the delivery of it is attended, being such as are best suited to
excite mens regard and command their reverence; I say, in proportion to the
means of conviction thus offered, mens inattention, irreverence and
disobedience receive additional degrees of aggravation, and subject them to
the more severe inflictions of the divine judgments.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

It seems that Sennacherib had, upon advice that Hirhakah King of Ethiopia was
come forth to make war with him, for awhile withdrawn his powers from Judea,
and marched out to give him battle: and having then defeated the allied army,
on which the Jews had placed no small confidence, he resumed his attempt upon
Jerusalem.

- Now all this may very well agree with the present supposition that this
transaction happened in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah. So that, on the whole,
we may consider the day, in which the Lord God of Hosts called the Jews to
repentance, not as a day of immediate trouble and distress, but rather as a
day of publick ease and security, and therefore a day of danger, of danger
more real and certain as being less suspected and foreseen, and, as such,
worthy of some extraordinary interposition.

The doctrine contained in the text, and which I would chiefly recommend to
your consideration, is the moral purpose of Fasting - that great end to which
all acts of abstinence are subordinate, as means; shewing, that the external
formality of observance will little avail, when destitute of the internal
principles of piety towards God, and charity towards our Neighbour.

If we find that we have abused our liberty, - perverting it into
licenciousness - if emboldened by impunity, and misled by example, we have
indulged our passions, unawed by any restraint of laws human or divine, let us
take this seasonable admonition, and apply our hearts unto wisdom, while we
reflect upon the mischievous consequences of our behaviour; that it really
tends to weaken and overturn that constitution in which we glory.

This instance of obedience to a human parent, one who had been in the grave
more than 200 years, and to whose memory they were attached by nothing more
than an hereditary feeling, is contrasted with the obstinate neglect of the

always over them.

that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these

by nature with moderate passions and desires, such as are disposed of their
own accord to kindness, sobriety, seriousness of mind, even these persons have
need to "exercise" themselves, - to pass such lives as require industry and
patience, - almost as much as others of less favoured temper, in whom the

It will thus be seen that the advantage which may be derived from the
knowledge of the fact, has a necessary dependance on the habitual religious
condition of the persons to whom it is communicated; and that the process by
which we are to take advantage of it, is a discipline just of the same sort as
that which we undergo in forming virtuous habits; so that to create a strong
impression on the mind, far from being the object of the Dispensation,
scarcely enters into its design: and if in any instance it accidentally
effects this, yet that by so doing it no more fulfils its final purpose, than
the excitement of good impulses completes a virtuous character.

with face which sees by any natural discernment of its own, but with face from
which the veil, which intercepted the light of Divine truth, has been removed
by another, that is by Christ and the Spirit of Christ, - "We, with face
unveiled" by Christ in our conversion to God, "beholding in a mirror," no

That aspect of God which seemed to be endangered by His own very vastness -
the personal aspect, if you will, or the living and loving nature - that for
which man's whole higher nature was athirst, that to which his most universal
and unfailing instincts had pointed clearly or dimly, nobly or grotesquely,
that which seemed essential to the authority of his conscience, and to his own
value as a spiritual being - that was brought to the front,

Their noble open-heartedness appeals to many who do not see deeper; who do not
recognize what strong and illuminating moral power is required to open the
heart to such steady and impartial admiration of that which is good, true, and
pure; what ready conscience and controlled attention is needed to 'think on
these things,' as the Apostle would understand thinking; and how far apart is
the admiration which really ennobles and constrains the heart from the languid
sentiment which may only leave us, as it passes, one degree more callous.

Though far inferior to the Apostle in gifts, or knowledge of what may be the
designs of the Almighty; yet, as a veteran in your service, who feels daily
the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

Indeed against them, it is proper from time to time to caution mankind:
because that is a corruption of Christianity expressly pointed out by Prophecy,
as what was to arise in the Church of Christ, and what is to continue for a
certain specific term and no longer: a corrupt Church, from whose Communion
God's "people" are exhorted to "come out" before its destruction; for that it
should come to an end and be destroyed with a signal destruction before the
coming of Christ to judgement.

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.
