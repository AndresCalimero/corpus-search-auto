But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first
castle at Deganwy. A warlike person, but whose habits of life were so loose
that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the
very Welsh.

As nothing is more engaging, or makes more lasting impressions, than the
politeness of foreigners who are vested with a supreme command shewn to such
officers of different nations who occasionally touch at the several ports
where they preside, or that does more honor to the power by whom they are
employed, it would be singular injustice not to mention the very great
character given the Dutch Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, by the Captains
of the British ships, on their voyages round the world, performed in the reign
of his present Majesty George III.

It is however intended to publish, in a very short Time, a second Volume,
containing all the Particulars of the remaining Part of our Voyage from
California, with exact Descriptions, not only of the Island Guam, but of all
other Places we touch'd at, or shall have Occasion to mention in our Way, the
Bearings of all the Coasts on the Back of America, from the Island of
California, to the Streights of Magellan, Draughts of many considerable
Harbours, taken from the Spanish Coasting-Pilots, and other curious Cuts,
which, with several Curiosities, too tedious to be here taken Notice of, will
render the Work as useful, instructive, and diverting, as any Book of this
Nature hitherto extant.
