neither able to read an Author with Ease, nor speak Latin fluently. Whereas it
is certain from Experience that such as learn the Modern Languages by

rheumatism, such painful affections of the muscular fibres, membranes, and
joints as are unattended with fever, specific virus, or peculiar derangement
of the stomach and bowels; and which are seldom accompanied with external
tumor or inflammation, but are very liable to shift suddenly from one part to
another, and are readily propagated along the course of the membranes and
muscular fibres.

I appeal to common Sense, if the having a Grammar of our Mother-Tongue first
taught in our Schools would not so far facilitate our Youths learning their
Latin and Greek Grammars, as to afford 'em spare-time for Arithmetic,
Astronomy, Geography, History, and other useful Knowledges, that would make
them pass the Spring of their Life with Pleasure and Profit, that is now
miserably worn out in Grammatical Perplexities.

The 'foremention'd Cicero, when advanc'd to the Consulship, was so far from
neglecting his Mother-Tongue, that in the heat of Civil War between Caesar and
Pompey, when he knew not whither to send Wife or Children, nor where to hide

satisfie him, whether he ought to write ad Piraeum, in Piraea, in Piraeum, or

Instead of teaching them patiently to endure pain and disappointment, and the

strength from indulgence, are often productive of trouble to others, and of

The insertion or inoculation of a cion or bud into the bole of a stock, for
the improvement and propagation of fruit trees, seems to be nothing more than
an artificial transplanting of those trees, just the same as though they were
put into suitable earth; by putting their seeds into a good proper soil,
whereby the seminal principles concentred in the seed, or contracted into
those prolific buds, are put into their proper matrix, which, with other
requisites concurring, are set into their vegetative spring, or fermental
motion.

Thus, for instance, we commonly inoculate a fruitful bud or cion of an apricot

&c. are in fact nothing more than the evident indexes of the action of the
seminal principles of those inoculated buds, which being set into motion, by
requisites duly concurring admit of the juice or sap of the bole, and becomes
fermental, dashing the preconceived seminal tincture of the stock, whereby it
was disposed to the putting on the form of a plum tree transmutes that juice
into its own nature, and so from the intestine strugglings of the said seminal
principles of the inoculated bud, proceeds the vegetation and growth of the
whole, clothing itself with all those natural liveries peculiar to the texture
of such seminal prolific principles.

Thus we see the bud or cion of an apricot is hastened as to its fructifying,
by being inserted into plum stocks; peaches by being put into apricot; as also
cherries, such as the Flanders kind, hart, duke, &c. put into wild or black
cherry stocks, by which means in two or three years they become fruit-bearing
trees, which if raised from the stones, or propagated from suckers, would not
come to pass till after many more;

68. Now, I think, I have directed you how to bring your Hive safe to the Month
of April, the Time, when Bees commonly set out in our Country to their Work,
and when they begin to increase their Family; for which End they lay their
Eggs in Cells, and go abroad to fetch in that Stuff commonly called Bee-Bread,
concerning which, its Preparation and Use in feeding young Bees, from their
first Formation, until they are able to provide for themselves, you shall be
informed before this Treatise is ended, in the Answers to Questions relative
to these Matters.

Dr. Reynolds, after pointing out that for the production of a complicated
movement, such as writing, the integrity of a great number of parts is
necessary - the will, motor and sensory nerve-fibres, certain ganglia situate
upon the nerve-trunks, the cerebellum, the muscles, and the special senses -
goes on to say that in the disease in question 'it $can $not be doubted that
some changes take place in the nutrition of the parts through which the lines
of nerve action, regulating the secondarily automatic movements, run.

in order, then to guard the inexperienced against impositions of this sort, it
will be necessary to apprise such, that a colt is foaled without teeth; in a
few days, he puts out four, which are called pincers, or nippers; soon after,
appear the four separators, next to the nippers; it is sometimes three or four
months before the next, called the corner teeth, push forth; these twelve
colt's teeth, in the front of the mouth, continue without alternation, till
the colt is two years and a half old, which makes it difficult, without great
care, to avoid being imposed upon during that interval, if the seller finds it
his interest to make the colt pass for either younger or older than he really
is; the only rule you then have to judge by is his coat, and the hairs of his
mane and tail.

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

but also of frequent Use in their Shops at Home, to their great Advantage in

This idea, too, has now been communicated to persons of education in general,
as the general reception of the Newtonian theory of the universe proves; while,
at the same time, the very indistinct views which men of considerable
cultivation often entertain of the mechanism of the universe, proves that the
fundamental ideas on which a clear apprehension of the doctrine of universal
attraction depends, have hitherto been very imperfectly diffused through the
