poured water and then acid over them; the carbonic acid immediately commenced
to escape with considerable effervescence - the appearance of boiling, which
is only the separation of one part of the marble from another.

larger, until, if it were possible, it became as large as the Earth itself -
or, I might take the Earth itself, as the large ball - that then the
attraction would become so powerful as to cause them to rush together in this
manner dropping the ivory ball.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

With regard to the phenomena which gave rise to the suspicion of one or more
rings, it must be noticed, that few specula or object-glasses are so very
perfect as not to be affected with some rays or inequalities, when high powers
are used, and the object to be viewed is very minute.

of the tube, which brings the observer close to the mouth of it, has
occasioned a visible defect in the view of a very minute object, when proper
care has not been taken to keep out of the way: especially when the wind is in
such a quarter as to come from the observer across the telescope.

of one of Jupiter's satellites by its entrance on the disk, I was in hopes

satellites: not indeed to measure the satellites, but to measure the planet
itself, by means of the passage of the satellite over its disk.

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

If the Italians, for example, in the early part of the twelfth century, had
discovered at Amalphi, instead of the pandects of Justinian, some ancient
manuscripts filled with astronomical observations relating to a period of
three thousand years, and made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical
instruments as perfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on
consulting these memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a
great revolution in the solar and sidereal systems.

In regard to the signs of upraising and sinking, of fracture and contortion in
rocks, it is evident that newer strata $can $not be shaken by earthquakes,
unless the subjacent rocks are also affected; so that the contrast in the
relative degree of disturbance in the more ancient and the newer strata, is
one of many proofs that the convulsions have happened in different eras, and
the fact confirms the uniformity of the action of subterranean forces, instead
of their greater violence in the primeval ages.

caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the
Subapennine hills, now exclusively tropical, to retain no longer any
representatives in the adjoining seas, has also contributed to the
annihilation of certain genera of land-mammifera, which inhabited the

But, if we suppose the change to have been extremely slow, and to have
consisted, not so much in a diminution of the mean annual temperature, as in
an alteration from what has been termed an "insular" to an "excessive" climate,
from one in which the temperature of winter and summer were nearly equalized
to one wherein the seasons were violently contrasted, we may, perhaps, explain

tube, and the other took the fire from it, they would both appear to be
electrified; that if they touched one another after that operation, a stronger
spark would be perceived between them, than when any other person touched
either of them; and that such a spark would take away the electricity of both.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,

He also says, that when the gilding was varnished even with turpentine, this
varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was
driven through paper, it would be blackened by the smoke, which sometimes
penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the

Dr. Franklin, retaining the common opinion, that electrified bodies have real
atmospheres of the electric fluid consisting of particles at some distance
from the surface of the body, but always going along with it observed that
these atmospheres and the air did not seem to exclude one another; though, he
says, this be difficult to conceive, considering that they are generally
supposed to repel one another.

electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following

the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.
