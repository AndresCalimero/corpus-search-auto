In the mean time, the Persian Fleet arriv'd at Aphetae, where discovering the
Smallness of the Grecian Fleet, which lay at Artemisium, the Persian Admirals
resolv'd to engage them; wherefore imagining, that the Grecians would
immediately fly at the first Motion of their Fleet, they sent 200 Sail,
ordering them to leave the Island Sciathus on their right, and launch into the
open Sea, lest, if they cruis'd too near Euboea, they should be seen by the
Enemy: And as soon as they pass'd Geraestus and Caphareus, lying upon the
extreme parts of Euboea, near the Mouth of the Straits, to sail up the River
Euripus, and fall upon the Grecians behind, while the rest of the Fleet, which
lay at Aphetae, attack'd them before, by which means they hop'd to destroy the
whole Grecian Fleet.

determine the Matter in the Straits; and that if they sail'd from thence, they
should inevitably loose Aegina, Megara, and Salamis, whereas by staying where
they then were, they should not only save those Places, but sufficiently
defend the Isthmus, which the Barbarians should not so much as once look upon,
if the Grecians got the Victory at Sea.

supported by all those Powers, in her Pretensions to her Crown; that her own
Roman-Catholick Subjects wish'd to have her dethroned, and were often in Plots
for that Purpose, in which they were encourag'd by foreign Powers, that the
Irish, who were strongly attach'd to the Pope, were rebellious, and occasion'd
many intestine Commotions in that Kingdom: And yet that in the Midst of all
she, without any Allies, supported herself thro' a long and glorious Reign:
defeated all the Projects of her Enemies, and kept the Crown unshaken on her
Head to the last, purely by her good Policy, and the Affection, Zeal and
Loyalty of her faithful Subjects, whom by her wise Behaviour she attach'd
firmly to her Interest: I say, if we consider all these Things, her vast and

About ten Days after, the Parliament met, who restor'd the First Fruits and
Tenths to the Crown, appointed publick Worship to be perform'd in the vulgar
Tongue, and restor'd the Queen to her Right of Supremacy in all Causes
Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil, empowering her to put the Exercise of it
into what Hands she pleased; which gave Rise to a new Court, call'd the
High-Commission-Court, in which several Commissioners had the same Power that
Cromwell had as $Viceregent in the Reign of Henry VIII.

not tell what to make of their good Protectress, who had even gone so far as
to stand Godmother to Charles's new-born Daughter, after the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; which might make one believe, that her Zeal for the Protestant
Religion was always subordinate to her private Interest. Tho' this must be
