The design of this and other like prophesies was to awaken that proud
luxurious people out of a state of unwarranted security - to make them
apprehensive of their real danger - to call off their trust from the arm of
flesh, from means merely human, their political wisdom and military power - to
direct their views to the Lord God of Hosts: to the end that they might feel
the necessity of humbling themselves under his mighty hand, and by the
reformation of their manners reconcile themselves to his favour, and engage
his protection.

special and important occasions: as when God raises up Prophets, the preachers
of righteousness and Heralds of his judgments empowered to declare to the
people some particular and interesting message.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

It seems that Sennacherib had, upon advice that Hirhakah King of Ethiopia was
come forth to make war with him, for awhile withdrawn his powers from Judea,
and marched out to give him battle: and having then defeated the allied army,
on which the Jews had placed no small confidence, he resumed his attempt upon
Jerusalem.

Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by

This Epistle therefore may be considered as a farewell to those who had
embraced Christianity; to exhort them to continue stedfast in the practice as
well as the profession of it: warning them of false teachers who would arise
in the bosom of the Church of Christ, and introduce erroneous doctrines into
it; as also, that "in the last days" there would be "scoffers, walking after
their own lusts;" who would blaspheme and deride Christianity, and set it at

stedfastness."

made of himself and of his will to mankind; to Adam, to the Patriarchs, to the
Israelites or Jews by Moses, and last of all by Jesus Christ his Son; whom he
sent in the nature and form of mortal man, to redeem mankind from sin and from
death; to proclaim pardon to us all, on repentance and amendment of life; to
assure us, through faith in him, of a resurrection to eternal life; and to
eternal happiness in that life, provided we exert our endeavors to live in
obedience to his commands during our continuance here; and with a promise,
that we shall receive the assistance of God's holy Spirit, if we seek and ask

But their supposing that Faith alone is to save men, without a suitable
Practice in the conduct of their lives, is as certainly an Error: which will
lead, and we see does lead some into the habitual practice of vice; from a
supposition that on account of their profession of Faith, they are secure of
happiness eternal, however they may behave; and which does lead others of
better disposition, into melancholy and despair, and thence too frequently
into absolute madness; from their not having presumption enough to pretend to
feel what they do not feel; or enthusiasm enough to fancy they feel an
assurance of their salvation, which frail man $can $not have.

Indeed against them, it is proper from time to time to caution mankind:
because that is a corruption of Christianity expressly pointed out by Prophecy,
as what was to arise in the Church of Christ, and what is to continue for a
certain specific term and no longer: a corrupt Church, from whose Communion
God's "people" are exhorted to "come out" before its destruction; for that it
should come to an end and be destroyed with a signal destruction before the
coming of Christ to judgement.

itself, and depart from all sense of right, as in these enlightened days to
question the existence of a Deity, whose wonderful works are better known than

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

A young Pope then in the chair, who had set on foot that traffic on a larger
scale, to refill his coffers emptied by the encouragement he had given to the
polite arts; insensed at such inquiry by one so far his inferior in rank,

emancipated thereby from the authority of the Church, prosecuted his inquiries
with redoubled ardor.

protested, was at that time, and continues to this day, and ought for ever to
