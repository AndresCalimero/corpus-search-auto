When the Court considers that the Lenox lay close a-stern of the Cornwal,
whilst she continued in Action, so that when the Cornwal quitted the Line by
reason of her shortening and backening Sail, and the Lenox keeping her Course,
and busily employed in hot Action, it was morally impossible to avoid falling
foul of her one way or other. If any Blame lies on this Occasion, when the
Court takes into Consideration, that Part of my Weather Maintopsail Yard-Arm,
and the Head of my Foretop-Mast Staysail were shot away, with the other Damage
in my Rigging, whereby it became impracticable to manage the Ship so readily
as otherwise might be; and that the Cornwal's Maintop-Mast being shot away,
together with her shortening and backening Sail, I leave it to your Judgment
to determine on whom the Blame lies;

I have sometimes thought that the real test of a schoolmaster or mistress
would be whether the children go on after they have left school liking to
inform themselves, liking to observe, liking to read up a thing: or whether
they forget all they have been taught, never to open a book, and even forget
how to read or write correctly. worse still, forget religion & morality.

My dear Sir Most heartily do I give you joy on the success of your 'Health at
Home' Education Mission - the enthusiastic attendance on your Lectures of
rural educated women from all over the County allowed to attend for their own
profit - your sifting & re-sifting till you obtained a Class of 12, who
appeared willing & able to become instructresses or missioners of Health to
the uneducated rural women at their own homes - the object of the whole course
being the new one not simply to give Sanitary information but to teach how to
teach - the examination by an independent well-known Sanitary authority - both
in writing & by word of mouth to test their power of speaking to the
uneducated And six of them passing the Exam'n with the utmost success three
indeed above what had been expected. the main object of the Exam'n being to
see not only if their book knowledge or theory were competent but if they
could give in the most practical & plainest, in the most lively & dramatic
manner - their knowledge to uneducated women in their own houses - translate
in fact the object-lessons they had received from your skill & kindness in the
worst houses of the worst villages - into the cottage life with their own
hands & tongue.

I then recommended that we should make over the French districts which should
fall into the hands of the Allies to officers to be appointed by the King of
France. That the intendants or principal Commissaries of the several armies
should be put in communication with these officers to be appointed by the King
of France, and should make upon them the requisitions for the several supplies
they should require for their armies respectively; that the King of $France
$'s officers should enforce these requisitions upon the country, taking care
to give to the owners proper receipts and vouchers for the property taken from
them; and that these receipts and vouchers should be taken up, and should be a
charge upon the French Government, to be hereafter established.
