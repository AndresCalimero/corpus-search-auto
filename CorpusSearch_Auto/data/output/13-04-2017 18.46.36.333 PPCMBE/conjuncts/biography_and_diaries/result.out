When we consider, in what height of the Nation's Prosperity, the Successor of
Queen Elizabeth came to this Throne, it seems amazing, that such a Pile of
English Fame and Glory, which her skilful Administration had erected, should,
in every following Reign, down to the Revolution, so unhappily moulder away,
in one continual Gradation of Political Errors: All which must have been
avoided, if the plain Rule, which that wise Princess left behind her, had been
observed, viz. That the Love of her People was the surest Support of her
Throne.

We had not been many Days at Nottingham before we heard, that the Prince of
Denmark, with some other great Persons, were gone off, from the King, to the
Prince of Orange, and that the Princess Anne, fearing the King her $Father $'s
Resentment might fall upon her, for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her
self, in the Night, from London, and was then within half a Days Journey of
Nottingham; on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News, that
two thousand of the King's Dragoons were in close pursuit to bring her back
Prisoner to London:

Now to give you, Sir, a farther Proof of how good a Taste my first hopeful
Entrance into Manhood set out with, I remember above twenty Years after, when
the same Lady had given the World four of the loveliest Daughters that ever
were gaz'd on, even after they were all nobly married, and were become the
reigning Toasts of every Party of Pleasure, their still lovely Mother had at
the same time her Votaries, and her Health very often took the Lead, in those
involuntary Triumphs of Beauty.

a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within

which, when truly merited, is perhaps, one of the most agreeable
Gratifications that venial Vanity can feel. A Happiness almost peculiar to the
Actor, insomuch that the best Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate
Admirers may be, yet, to unite them into one general Act of Praise, to receive
at once, those thundring Peals of Approbation, which a crouded Theatre throws
out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor, to raise and

Not to dwell too long therefore upon that Part of my History, which I have
only collected, from oral Tradition, I shall content my self with telling you
that Mohun, and Hart now growing old for, above thirty Years before this Time,
they had severally born the King's Commission of Major and Captain, in the
Civil Wars, and the younger Actors, as Goodman, Clark, and others, being
impatient to get into their Parts, and growing intractable, the Audiences too
of both Houses then falling off, the Patentees of each, by the King's Advice,
which perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests, and both
Companies into one, exclusive of all others, in the Year 1684.

of Colonel Gardiner will invite many of our Officers and Soldiers, to whom his
Name has long been honourable and dear, to peruse this Account of him with
some peculiar Attention: In Consequence of which, it may be a Means of
increasing the Number, and brightening the Character, of those who are already

Her Second Son, the worthy Person of whom I am now to give a more particular
Account, was born at Carriden, in Linlithgow-Shire, on the 10th of January,
A.D. 1687-8, the memorable Year of that glorious Revolution which he justly
esteem'd among the happiest of all Events. So that, when he was slain in the
Defence of those Liberties, which God then by so gracious a Providence rescued
from utter Destruction, i.e. on the 21st of September 1745, he was aged 57
Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days.

Years, which lay between the 16th and 30th of his Life; except it be, that he
frequently experienced the Divine Goodness in renewed Instances, particularly
in preserving him in several hot Military Actions, in all which, he never
received so much as a Wound after this, forward as he was in tempting Danger;
and yet, that all these Years were spent in an entire Alienation from God, and
an eager Pursuit of Animal Pleasure, as his Supreme Good.

And which I think deserves particular Remark though he assuredly believed that
he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,
and to that Blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a Manner set forth

Nevertheless, he had such a Sense of the Evil of Sin, of the Goodness of the
Divine Being, and of the admirable Tendency of the Christian revelation, that
he resolved to spend the Remainder of his Life, while God continued him out of
Hell, in as rational and as useful a Manner as he could; and to continue
casting himself at the Feet of Divine Mercy, every day, and often in a day, if
peradventure there might be Hope of Pardon, of which all that he could say was,
that he did not absolutely despair.

grown to him, and that he was now in the Prime of Life, and all this while in
high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very

Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and

left eye; a great powdered wig, hanging at the side in curls, and in the
centre at the back a large black cockade, with a small drop curl from it; his
embroidered waistcoat down to his knees; the top of his coat not within three
inches of his neck, the hip buttons about a foot from it; buttons all the way
down the coat, but only one at the waist buttoned; the hilt of the sword
through the opening of the skirt; a long cravat, fringed, the end pulled
through the third button-hole; small buckles; the coat sleeves very short, and
the shirt sleeves pulled down, but hid by the top of the gloves, and the
ruffles hanging out at the opening of the cuff; the waistcoat entirely open
except the lower button, displaying the finely plaited frill.

I should have at once considered the waters of the Lac de Chede to be
cupriferous, had it not been for their excessive clearness, and for the
presence of numerous water serpents, one of which we caught as it was twisting
about among the grass and reeds near the shore, holding its head well above
water. About 14 inches long I believe there are some nearly a yard, belly
yellow, back yellow with green chequers, head green with a yellow ring round

to the King by some of the nobility, but they would not introduce her, and
that she waited as the King came through the room and then fell upon her knees

from her.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

Bradley's paper was very good, excepting from the one fatal defect to me its
chief merit, that he did not realise the least the deadly character of his own
admissions against hostels, and proceeds at the end to suggest improvements.
As if the only true thing was not fairly to admit their great evils, and then
if it $can $not be helped, to have them with eyes opened as being the best
that can be got, instead of whitewashing the sepulchre.

We decided to drop Greek entirely in the three lowest classes, with a view of
getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.

But to Lord Canning, the son of Palmerston's old tutor in politics, the
Canning who had been so hard on Palmerston in the Don Pacifico debate, the
Canning who had gone to India most unwillingly in obedience to Palmerston's
commands, the Canning to have said a word against whom required the
self-annihilation of a Minister, Canning who completed by his death his
victory in the country he had been sent to govern, - to him and to those brave
men whom the Mutiny, bursting from its swarthy ranks, had found in India, the
first praise for crushing it is due.
