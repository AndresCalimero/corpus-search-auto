Towards Llandudno and the Orme, a couple of miles away, a pleasant sandy shore
divides the sea from wild commons all aglow with gorse and bracken, rolling
here into sand-hills where tufty, bent grass quivers precariously in the wind,
or sinking there into cuppy, sheltered hollows where sheep nibble upon soft
carpets of immemorial turf; while in the north the great mass of the Orme
rises grimly out of the sea from its encircling fringe of foam.

1188, and firmly believed the local superstition that the Conway travelled far
out to sea, "preserving its stream inviolate" - "I must not pass over in
silence the mountains called Eryri by the Welsh, and by the English Snowdon,
or mountains of snow, which gradually increasing from the land of the Sons of
Conan, and extending themselves northward even to Deganwy, seem to rear their
lofty summits to the clouds.

Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first
castle at Deganwy. A warlike person, but whose habits of life were so loose
that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the

such salutes, under the instructions of the present philharmonic First Lord of

having pass'd the Magellan Streights, in the Year 1615, and sail'd up the
