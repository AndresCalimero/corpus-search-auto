whereas it was a manifest Advantage to them, who had the fewer Ships, to
determine the Matter in the Straits; and that if they sail'd from thence, they
should inevitably loose Aegina, Megara, and Salamis, whereas by staying where
they then were, they should not only save those Places, but sufficiently
defend the Isthmus, which the Barbarians should not so much as once look upon,
if the Grecians got the Victory at Sea.

About ten Days after, the Parliament met, who restor'd the First Fruits and
Tenths to the Crown, appointed publick Worship to be perform'd in the vulgar
Tongue, and restor'd the Queen to her Right of Supremacy in all Causes
Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil, empowering her to put the Exercise of it
into what Hands she pleased; which gave Rise to a new Court, call'd the
High-Commission-Court, in which several Commissioners had the same Power that
Cromwell had as $Viceregent in the Reign of Henry VIII.
