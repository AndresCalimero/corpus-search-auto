When we consider, in what height of the Nation's Prosperity, the Successor of
Queen Elizabeth came to this Throne, it seems amazing, that such a Pile of
English Fame and Glory, which her skilful Administration had erected, should,
in every following Reign, down to the Revolution, so unhappily moulder away,
in one continual Gradation of Political Errors: All which must have been
avoided, if the plain Rule, which that wise Princess left behind her, had been
observed, viz. That the Love of her People was the surest Support of her
Throne.

Did not the Actions of almost every succeeding Reign shew, there were still so
many Doors of Oppression left open to the Prerogative, that whatever Value our
most eloquent Legislators may have set upon those ancient Liberties I doubt it
will be difficult to fix the Period of their having a real Being, before the
Revolution: Or if there ever was an elder Period of our unmolested enjoying
them, I own, my poor Judgment is at a loss where to place it.

We had not been many Days at Nottingham before we heard, that the Prince of
Denmark, with some other great Persons, were gone off, from the King, to the
Prince of Orange, and that the Princess Anne, fearing the King her $Father $'s
Resentment might fall upon her, for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her
self, in the Night, from London, and was then within half a Days Journey of
Nottingham; on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News, that
two thousand of the King's Dragoons were in close pursuit to bring her back
Prisoner to London:

That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

To these laudable Distinctions let me add one more; that of Publick Applause,
which, when truly merited, is perhaps, one of the most agreeable
Gratifications that venial Vanity can feel. A Happiness almost peculiar to the
Actor, insomuch that the best Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate
Admirers may be, yet, to unite them into one general Act of Praise, to receive
at once, those thundring Peals of Approbation, which a crouded Theatre throws
out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor, to raise and

that Mohun, and Hart now growing old for, above thirty Years before this Time,
they had severally born the King's Commission of Major and Captain, in the
Civil Wars, and the younger Actors, as Goodman, Clark, and others, being
impatient to get into their Parts, and growing intractable, the Audiences too
of both Houses then falling off, the Patentees of each, by the King's Advice,
which perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests, and both
Companies into one, exclusive of all others, in the Year 1684.

the Account of them by observing, that, on the 24th of January 1729-30, he was

upon him, when, in the Beginning of the Year 1715, he intrusted him with the
important Dispatches, relating to a Discovery, which by a Series of admirable
Policy he had made, of a Design which the French King was then forming, for
invading Great Britain in favour of the Pretender; in which the French
apprehended they were so sure of Success, that it seemed a Point of Friendship
in one of the chief Counsellors of that Court, to dissuade a Dependent of his
from accepting some Employment under his Britannick Majesty, when proposed by
his Envoy there; because it was said, that in less than Six Weeks there would
be a Revolution, in favour of what they called the Family of the Stewarts.

But the Major was so little affected with what had befallen him, that when
some of his gay Friends, on hearing the Story, rallied him upon the Efficacy
of his Prayers, he excused himself from the scandal of being thought much in
earnest, by saying, "That it was at Midnight, an Hour when his good Mother and
Aunt were asleep; or else he should have left that Part of the Business to
them." A Speech, which I should not have mentioned, but as it shews in so
lively a view the wretch'd Situation of his Mind at that Time, though his
great Deliverance from the Power of Darkness was then nearly approaching.

have sometimes been tempted to suppress many Circumstances of it; not only as

And which I think deserves particular Remark though he assuredly believed that
he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,
and to that Blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a Manner set forth

And indeed, when I consider how habitual all those criminal Indulgences were
grown to him, and that he was now in the Prime of Life, and all this while in
high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very
Constitution, that he was used strangely to think, and to say, that
Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and
giving him another.

to those who have been used to a sick room, when it says in the morning he
asked the hour, they told him six, he answered, all went on regularly, he felt
he had but a few hours to live, every thing rushed into mind, all the
accompaniments, the expiring rush light, as day begins to break, the
attendants stalking about gently after sitting up all night, whispering to
each other and now & then drawing back the window curtain to see how near the
day, the Stars twinkling like gems, as if they were doing their utmost before
they are extinguished by the Sun - and Johnson with proven energy in his
expiring awful voice begging mercy at intervals of the Almighty.

I remember Captain Debrisay, who, upwards of seventy years of age, walked the
streets of Dublin unremarked, in the old dress, worn in the days of Charles
the Second; a large cocked hat, all on one side his face, nearly covering his
left eye; a great powdered wig, hanging at the side in curls, and in the
centre at the back a large black cockade, with a small drop curl from it; his
embroidered waistcoat down to his knees; the top of his coat not within three
inches of his neck, the hip buttons about a foot from it; buttons all the way
down the coat, but only one at the waist buttoned; the hilt of the sword
through the opening of the skirt; a long cravat, fringed, the end pulled
through the third button-hole; small buckles; the coat sleeves very short, and
the shirt sleeves pulled down, but hid by the top of the gloves, and the
ruffles hanging out at the opening of the cuff; the waistcoat entirely open
except the lower button, displaying the finely plaited frill.

his uncle, Arthur Murphy, coming to London, Mac Nally brought him to
Covent-garden Theatre to see it; when, to the surprise of the author, and the
vexation of both, the opera was that night performed as an afterpiece, having
been, without his knowledge, cut down into two acts: such the mortifications
of even a successful dramatic poet.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

well assured that several foreign princes had furnished the Pretender with +L
1,500,000 for his expedition into Scotland. The Pope had promised him, +L
200,000 upon his landing and that he had already received the greatest part of

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

the consent of the traders to that sea, Denmark taking upon itself the charge
of constructing lighthouses, and erecting signals, to mark the shoals and
rocks from the Cattegat to the Baltic: and they, on their part, agreeing that
all ships should pass this way, in order that all might pay their shares: none
from that time using the passage of the Belt; because it was not fitting that
they, who enjoyed the benefit of the beacons in dark and stormy weather,
should evade contributing to them in fair seasons and summer nights.

chief merit, that he did not realise the least the deadly character of his own

if it $can $not be helped, to have them with eyes opened as being the best
that can be got, instead of whitewashing the sepulchre.

But to Lord Canning, the son of Palmerston's old tutor in politics, the
Canning who had been so hard on Palmerston in the Don Pacifico debate, the
Canning who had gone to India most unwillingly in obedience to Palmerston's
commands, the Canning to have said a word against whom required the
self-annihilation of a Minister, Canning who completed by his death his
victory in the country he had been sent to govern, - to him and to those brave
men whom the Mutiny, bursting from its swarthy ranks, had found in India, the
first praise for crushing it is due.
