This is one of the house Spiders, whose vertues are excellent in the cure of
intermitting fevers, when the bark and other remedies have failed, as I have
often experienced on several, both old and young; the use of which I will now
publish for the benefit of the poor and country people, who are remote from
the help of physicians.

By this method I have cured many people of stubborn and long continu'd tertian,
quartan, and quotidian Fevers, particularly some of the servants of the
Honourable Colonel Schutz, when their taking the Bark for a long time failed:
as also Dame Hughs of Tottenham-Court Road of a tertian Ague of three years
continuance, with many others.

and yet we know that such is the case, because if, instead of taking a small
ivory ball, we take a mountain, and put a ball like this near it, we find that,
owing to the vast size of the mountain, as compared with the billiard ball,
the latter is drawn slightly towards it; showing clearly that an attraction
does exist, just as it did between the shell-lac which I rubbed and the piece
of paper which was over turned by it.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

If the Italians, for example, in the early part of the twelfth century, had
discovered at Amalphi, instead of the pandects of Justinian, some ancient
manuscripts filled with astronomical observations relating to a period of
three thousand years, and made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical
instruments as perfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on
consulting these memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a
great revolution in the solar and sidereal systems.

processes then going on in certain parts of the Mediterranean, they would have

size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the

He says, that when a tube lined with any non-electric is rubbed, what is
collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

From this experiment it was evident, he says, that the atmosphere about the
cup was diminished by raising the chain, and increased by lowering it; and
that the atmosphere of the chain must have been drawn from that of the cup
when it was raised, and have returned to it again when it was let down.
