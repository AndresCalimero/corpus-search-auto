But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Says Giraldus, who brought his archbishop across this very ferry in the year
1188, and firmly believed the local superstition that the Conway travelled far
out to sea, "preserving its stream inviolate" - "I must not pass over in
silence the mountains called Eryri by the Welsh, and by the English Snowdon,
or mountains of snow, which gradually increasing from the land of the Sons of
Conan, and extending themselves northward even to Deganwy, seem to rear their
lofty summits to the clouds.

that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

It really must be a fine thing to be Mayor of Conway; a different matter
altogether from presiding at the civic board of Pedlington-in-the-Marsh or
Smokeborough-on-Sea. To flaunt your robes and chains of office against such a
background as the panelled walls of Pla`s Mawr, and to pass in and out of your
domain beneath $heavy-browed feudal gateways. Above all, to be Constable, as
the Mayors of Conway are, of King Edward's stately pile, and do its honours to
deputations of learned and distinguished bodies, who in these particulars are
among the great ones of the earth.

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the
very Welsh.

the 20th of September, had sight of the Land of New Spain, in the Latitude of
13 Deg. 30 Min. then stood off to Sea, the Weather proving foul, and, October

Bearings of all the Coasts on the Back of America, from the Island of

Harbours, taken from the Spanish Coasting-Pilots, and other curious Cuts,
which, with several Curiosities, too tedious to be here taken Notice of, will
render the Work as useful, instructive, and diverting, as any Book of this

The frequent recurrence of solemn sounds from a variety of $deep-toned
instruments, after short pauses of profound silence; the low hum of invocation,
during both night and day; and occasionally the more vociferous clamour of
crowded congregations, joined with a full choral band; left me no room to
doubt, that I was close to the scene, of some of the most solemn and
mysterious ceremonies of their religion.

Nor can, perhaps, the inhabitants of a rocky, arid, bleak, and naked region,
fancy a scene more enchanting, than is exhibited in a country of wide extent,
presenting throughout a smooth and equal surface, clothed with eternal verdure,
intersected by numberless deep and copious rivers, abounding with groves of
large and shady trees, and yielding an immense variety of fruits and flowers,
through every season of the year.
