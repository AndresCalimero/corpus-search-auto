But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Says Giraldus, who brought his archbishop across this very ferry in the year
1188, and firmly believed the local superstition that the Conway travelled far
out to sea, "preserving its stream inviolate" - "I must not pass over in
silence the mountains called Eryri by the Welsh, and by the English Snowdon,
or mountains of snow, which gradually increasing from the land of the Sons of
Conan, and extending themselves northward even to Deganwy, seem to rear their
lofty summits to the clouds.

It really must be a fine thing to be Mayor of Conway; a different matter
altogether from presiding at the civic board of Pedlington-in-the-Marsh or
Smokeborough-on-Sea. To flaunt your robes and chains of office against such a
background as the panelled walls of Pla`s Mawr, and to pass in and out of your
domain beneath $heavy-browed feudal gateways. Above all, to be Constable, as
the Mayors of Conway are, of King Edward's stately pile, and do its honours to
deputations of learned and distinguished bodies, who in these particulars are
among the great ones of the earth.

In speaking of the several Adventurers into the South Sea, we brought Sir
Francis Drake to the North Part of the Coast of Peru, whence he continu'd his
Course still Northward, out at Sea, without ever touching, or coming in Sight
of the Coast of New Spain, 'till the 5th of June 1578, when being in the
Latitude of 43 Degrees, and finding it very cold, he stood in for the Land,
which they tell us was not mountainous, and fell into a good Bay, in 38
Degrees Latitude.

having pass'd the Magellan Streights, in the Year 1615, and sail'd up the
Coast of Chile and Peru, as was there said, cross'd the Equinoctial and, on
the 20th of September, had sight of the Land of New Spain, in the Latitude of
13 Deg. 30 Min. then stood off to Sea, the Weather proving foul, and, October
the 1st, came in Sight of Land again; but the Sea still running high, beat off
