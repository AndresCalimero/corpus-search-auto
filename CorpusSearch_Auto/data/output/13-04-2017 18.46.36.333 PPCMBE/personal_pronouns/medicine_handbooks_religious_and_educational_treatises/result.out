It is evident by Experience, that there are several Arts and Sciences, which
$can $not be learn'd in any great Perfection, without the Knowledge of Latin,
or Greek, or other Antient Languages. Upon which Account it must be confess'd,
that those Persons. who design to Study such Arts or Sciences, ought to be
very well acquainted with these Languages; seeing an imperfect Knowledge of
them, only serves for Ostentation amongst the Ignorant, but is of no great
real use or Advantage.

The Learned Gaspar Scioppius, in his Preface to his Phylosophical Grammar,
tells us, that after he had Learn'd to decline Nouns and Verbs, by daily
Conversing with those who talk'd Latin; he was so good a Proficient in that
Language, that in Six Month's Time he cou'd express himself in it, concerning
all such Matters as he had occasion to Discourse about.

It will be proper to premise, that I mean to include under the term chronic
rheumatism, such painful affections of the muscular fibres, membranes, and
joints as are unattended with fever, specific virus, or peculiar derangement
of the stomach and bowels; and which are seldom accompanied with external
tumor or inflammation, but are very liable to shift suddenly from one part to
another, and are readily propagated along the course of the membranes and
muscular fibres.

rheumatism of elderly persons, where the muscles and tendons have been rigid,
and the joints nearly inflexible, in consequence of the disease having been
brought on by excessive labor, hard fare, dampness, and cold. 2nd. In women
whose constitutions have been worn out by repeated rheumatic attacks after
parturition, and more especially in the decline of life.

My idea of an intellectual person is one whose mind is alive to ideas; who is
interested in politics, religion, science, history, literature; who knows
enough to wish to know more, and to listen if he $can $not talk; a person who
is not at the mercy of a new book, a leading article, or the chatter of an
irresponsible outsider; a person who is not insular, provincial, narrow-minded,

be affected by this in some degree.

taught in our Schools would not so far facilitate our Youths learning their
Latin and Greek Grammars, as to afford 'em spare-time for Arithmetic,
Astronomy, Geography, History, and other useful Knowledges, that would make

The first thing beginners are taught in this school, is the use of language in
general, the letters of the Roman alphabet, their powers and different classes,
the way of combining syllables into words, the nature of a noun, both
substantive and adjective, the declension of an English noun, and the
terminations of Latin nouns as they correspond to the different cases of the
five declensions.

Therefore making that Title Debtor to every Accompt I lose on, and Creditor by
every Accompt I gain on, the Difference betwixt the Debtor and Creditor side,
shows my nett Gain or Loss; that is, If the Sums on the Debtor side being
collected, do not amount to the Sums on the Credit side; so much as it takes
to ballance or make up the Value of the Sums on the opposite side, so much is
my real Gain, and e` contra.

The implements generally made use of in the art of grafting are the following:
A fine small hand saw, to cut off the heads of large stocks; a good strong
knife, with a thick back, to make clefts in the stocks; a sharp penknife, to
cut the grafts; a grafting chissel, and a small mallet, to pare away the wood;
bass or woollen yarn to tie the grafts with; and a quantity of clay or cement,
properly prepared, to lay over the incisions, in order to prevent their
bleeding, and keep out the air.

The insertion or inoculation of a cion or bud into the bole of a stock, for
the improvement and propagation of fruit trees, seems to be nothing more than
an artificial transplanting of those trees, just the same as though they were
put into suitable earth; by putting their seeds into a good proper soil,
whereby the seminal principles concentred in the seed, or contracted into
those prolific buds, are put into their proper matrix, which, with other
requisites concurring, are set into their vegetative spring, or fermental
motion.

by being inserted into plum stocks; peaches by being put into apricot; as also
cherries, such as the Flanders kind, hart, duke, &c. put into wild or black
cherry stocks, by which means in two or three years they become fruit-bearing
trees, which if raised from the stones, or propagated from suckers, would not
come to pass till after many more;

climates they lived in, their different ages, ways of life, and constitutions.
Upon which subject, I shall here observe, that, considering how often animals,
as well as plants, as appears by many experiments, are in an absorbing and
bibulous condition, the exact quantity perspired $can $not at all times be
justly determined, without knowing the quantity imbibed.

It would be foreign to my purpose, to observe what various degrees and kinds
of putrefaction may be induced in the human body by other means, viz. by
putrid ferments, or putrid substances of any kind, contagious poisons, and
acrimony of different sorts, either taken inwardly, or outwardly applied; as

in such circumstances as have been described, and the want of fresh greens or

I imagine it would be unnecessary to insist long in shewing how, in the
unavoidable hardships that sometimes attend seamen in long voyages, or the
besieged shut up in towns; as likewise in times of scarcity or famine, or when
people at any time use putrid flesh or fish, mouldy bread, or unwholsome
waters; how, I say, from such corrupted substances, the scorbutic taint might
probably be induced in the body.

Dr. Reynolds, after pointing out that for the production of a complicated
movement, such as writing, the integrity of a great number of parts is
necessary - the will, motor and sensory nerve-fibres, certain ganglia situate
upon the nerve-trunks, the cerebellum, the muscles, and the special senses -
goes on to say that in the disease in question 'it $can $not be doubted that
some changes take place in the nutrition of the parts through which the lines
of nerve action, regulating the secondarily automatic movements, run.

which are common to fibres passing through distinct but contiguous
nerve-trunks, and that it is owing to some nutrition change in them - the

produced;

Having thus defined the external parts of a horse, and I trust in such a
manner as to enable the most inexperienced therein to know how to affix proper
names to the respective parts, when discoursing about so useful an animal, and
to understand others when they shall make use of the same. I next proceed to
pourtray the properties of a good horse, a knowledge of which is of the
greatest importance to young speculators in an article, where a well informed

in order, then to guard the inexperienced against impositions of this sort, it
will be necessary to apprise such, that a colt is foaled without teeth; in a
few days, he puts out four, which are called pincers, or nippers; soon after,
appear the four separators, next to the nippers; it is sometimes three or four
months before the next, called the corner teeth, push forth; these twelve
colt's teeth, in the front of the mouth, continue without alternation, till
the colt is two years and a half old, which makes it difficult, without great
care, to avoid being imposed upon during that interval, if the seller finds it
his interest to make the colt pass for either younger or older than he really
is; the only rule you then have to judge by is his coat, and the hairs of his
mane and tail.

innumerable pipes and vessels are contrived, as so many canals, through which
the blood and humours constantly circulate, when the animal is in a perfect

The blood being constantly propelled towards the excretory pores of the skin,
by the constant dilation and contraction of the arteries, is the cause of
perspiration; besides which, there is an internal heat, or rarifying virtue,
that expands the fluids, opens the pores, and resolves moisture into exceeding
fine vapours, from which it is easy to infer, that the greater the force is,
by which the blood or humours are driven to the surface of the body of any

other parts, because when a horse has been heated, and suffered to cool
suddenly, the acrid scrum and perspirable matter, drove back from the skin,
falls upon the windpipe and lungs, and so occasions coughing, which is an

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

With a fuller knowledge of the distinctive characteristics of the many
beautiful trees, shrubs, &c., that had been introduced from Japan, and the
increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the various phases of garden
design that had long found favour in that country, it is not surprising that a
strong desire should have been felt by many owners of gardens within the
British Isles to create gardens more or less in accordance with Japanese ideas.

One of the principal rules governing the work of the landscape gardener in
Japan is to follow nature as far as is practicable, and to arrange the
arborescent and other forms of plant life in their natural associations. That
is to say, plants which in a state of nature have their home on the mountain
side are not to be brought down to those parts of the garden which represent
the lowlands, and, it may be, used in the formation of a flowery fringe to
running stream or silent pool.

But, as some Persons may be engag'd in Business, wherein is very little Use of
this Science, by which Means they may be liable to forget what they had
learn'd; and others may be so hastily enter'd upon what may very much require
it, as not to have Time to obtain a sufficient Knowledge therein, I sometime
ago publish'd a little Treatise, in a neat Pocket Volume, under the Title of
Arithmetick in Epitome, or, a Compendium of all its Rules, both Vulgar and
Decimal. Which Book, as it was chiefly intended, and, at first, particularly
dedicated to the ingenious Clerks and Accomptants of the several Offices of
Great Britain, so it has so far had the good Fortune to please, as to have

lectures, practical teaching is applicable only to a limited range of subjects;
