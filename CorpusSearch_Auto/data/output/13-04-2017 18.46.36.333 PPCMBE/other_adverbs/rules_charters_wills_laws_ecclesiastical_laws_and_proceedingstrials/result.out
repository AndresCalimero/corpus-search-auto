I $do $n't doubt but, in the Course of our Evidence, we shall make it appear
to your Satisfaction, that the Prisoner with two others, whose Names are Blood
and Fletcher, and other their Confederates, did assemble in a warlike Manner,
and procured Arms, Ammunition, and other Instruments of War; and compos'd a
Regiment for the Service of the Pretender to these Realms, to wage War against
his present most sacred Majesty; and did march through and invade several
Parts of this Kingdom, and unlawfully did seize his Majesty's Treasure in many
Places for the Service of their villainous Cause, and took away the Horses and
other Goods, Merchandize, and Chattels of many of his Majesty's peaceable
Subjects. And that, during the said March, the Prisoner, with other Rebels in
open Defiance of his Majesty's undoubted Right and Title to the Crown of these
Realms, frequently caused the Pretender's Son to be proclaimed, $in a publick
and solemn Manner, as Regent of these Realms, and himself march'd at the Head
of a pretended Regiment which they call'd the Manchester Regiment.

This Witness farther depos'd, that when they were at Derby with the Rebel Army,
they beat up for Volunteers for the Manchester Regiment, commanded by the
Honourable Colonel Francis Townley, and that the same was done by the
particular Order and Direction of the Prisoner. That when the Rebel Army
retreated from Derby, Col. Townley the Prisoner, and some of his Regiment,
took out of a House between Derby and Ashborn, a Sack full of Arms, which were
concealed under some old Writings; that the said Arms were taken with them to
Ashborn, and lodg'd all Night in the Prisoner's own Room, and dispos'd of
afterwards among his Men; that the Prisoner had two Centinels always at his
Door all Night for fear the Duke of Cumberland was nearer to them then they
imagined; that the Prisoner march'd as Col. of the Manchester Regiment, in
their Retreat from Derby to Carlisle some Times at the Head of the Regiment;
that when they came to Carlisle, the Prisoner was made by the Pretender's Son
Commandant of Carlisle; and had another Commission given him by the
Pretender's Son to raise a Regiment of Horse; that so soon as the main Body of
the Rebel Army were gone from Carlisle for Scotland, he the Prisoner took on
him the Command of the whole Rebel Forces left there, and that he gave Orders
for the Guns to be mounted, and also ordered a House to be burnt; which was
accordingly done, alledging that several of the King's Forces had fired from
it, and annoyed the Pretender's Army; and that he particularly directed and
caused several Chevaux de Frize to be made and fix'd at the Gates and
Entrances to the City, to prevent his Majesty's Horse or Dragoons from
approaching it; that the Prisoner order'd some of the Rebel Army then in
Carlisle, to make a Sally out to bring in some Sheep, and that the Prisoner
mounted the Walls, with a Pistol in his Hand, to give Notice if the King's
Forces was near where the Men were to go; that the Prisoner paid the Men of
his own Company himself, as all the Captains of Companies did theirs; and that
he had heard the Prisoner, when in Carlisle in Company with other Officers,
complain that he was fourscore Pounds out of Pocket in paying his Men; that,
before the Capitulation, this Witness heard the Prisoner have some Words, and
was seemingly in a great Passion with Colonel Hamilton, who was Governor of
the Castle or Citadel of Carlisle, for surrendering the Place, and not making
a Defence to the last; and that he heard the Prisoner declare, that it was
better to die by the Sword, than to fall into the Hands of those damn'd
Hanoverians.
