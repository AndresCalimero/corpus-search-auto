more adviseable to withstand the Enemy at his first Entrance into Greece, than
to defend it afterwards in broken Parts, immediately sent away 10000 Men into
Thessaly, under the Conduct of Enaenetus a Spartan, and Themistocles, who in
Conjunction with the Thessalian Horse, at the River Peneus, flowing between
the Streights of Ossa and Olympus, might hinder the Passage of the Persians.
