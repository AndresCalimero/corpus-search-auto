That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

But to Lord Canning, the son of Palmerston's old tutor in politics, the
Canning who had been so hard on Palmerston in the Don Pacifico debate, the
Canning who had gone to India most unwillingly in obedience to Palmerston's
commands, the Canning to have said a word against whom required the
self-annihilation of a Minister, Canning who completed by his death his
victory in the country he had been sent to govern, - to him and to those brave
men whom the Mutiny, bursting from its swarthy ranks, had found in India, the
first praise for crushing it is due.
