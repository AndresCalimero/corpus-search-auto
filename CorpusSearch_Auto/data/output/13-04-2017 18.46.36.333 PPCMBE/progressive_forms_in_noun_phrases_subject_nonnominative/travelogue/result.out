Beneath the lower wall of the old town, on the rude wharf and beach, where
nets and boats and sails lie about in much confusion, and where the sea-going
folk congregate, and mostly live, you may note over humble doors characters
inscribed that the total stranger to Welsh might be apt to carelessly pass
over as the mystic tongue of the country.

1188, and firmly believed the local superstition that the Conway travelled far
out to sea, "preserving its stream inviolate" - "I must not pass over in
silence the mountains called Eryri by the Welsh, and by the English Snowdon,
or mountains of snow, which gradually increasing from the land of the Sons of
Conan, and extending themselves northward even to Deganwy, seem to rear their

Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first
castle at Deganwy. A warlike person, but whose habits of life were so loose
that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.
