But their supposing that Faith alone is to save men, without a suitable
Practice in the conduct of their lives, is as certainly an Error: which will
lead, and we see does lead some into the habitual practice of vice; from a
supposition that on account of their profession of Faith, they are secure of
happiness eternal, however they may behave; and which does lead others of
better disposition, into melancholy and despair, and thence too frequently
into absolute madness; from their not having presumption enough to pretend to
feel what they do not feel; or enthusiasm enough to fancy they feel an

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

Nay, since religion, if a man be sincere, must be next to his heart; and every
man must believe according to the conviction of his own, not another's,
understanding; and must be zealous to worship God accordingly; the Ruling
Powers of a state, can have no right to abridge any man of the liberty of so
doing; nor to lay any restraints upon him on that account; excepting when,
under the pretense of religion, the principles he avows interfere with the
concerns of the state.
