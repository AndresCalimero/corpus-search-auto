When the Court considers that the Lenox lay close a-stern of the Cornwal,
whilst she continued in Action, so that when the Cornwal quitted the Line by
reason of her shortening and backening Sail, and the Lenox keeping her Course,
and busily employed in hot Action, it was morally impossible to avoid falling
foul of her one way or other. If any Blame lies on this Occasion, when the
Court takes into Consideration, that Part of my Weather Maintopsail Yard-Arm,
and the Head of my Foretop-Mast Staysail were shot away, with the other Damage
in my Rigging, whereby it became impracticable to manage the Ship so readily
as otherwise might be; and that the Cornwal's Maintop-Mast being shot away,
together with her shortening and backening Sail, I leave it to your Judgment

Sir, We humbly conceive it is our Duty to represent to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that in the Action between his Majesty's Squadron, and that
of Spain, which happened on the first of Octob. 1748, near the Havanna, that
by Rear-Admiral Knowles's bad Conduct, mistaken Signals, and $Un-Officerlike
Attack, he gave great Advantage to the Enemy; by engaging in a straggling Line
a superior Squadron drawn up in a close Line of Battle, late in the Day, when
he might have attacked them much earlier, and to greater Advantage. That his
Majesty's Ship Cornwal was not in the Action an Hour. That to the great
Dishonour of the British Flag, Rear-Admiral Knowles, not only unnecessarily
carried, but kept his Majesty's Flag out of Action. That he has endeavoured to
deceive his Majesty, their Lordships, and the Publick, by having transmitted a
false and injurious Account of the said Action, to Mr. Corbet, by Letter of
the 2d of October 1748; all which we are ready to prove,

I have sometimes thought that the real test of a schoolmaster or mistress
would be whether the children go on after they have left school liking to
inform themselves, liking to observe, liking to read up a thing: or whether
they forget all they have been taught, never to open a book, and even forget
how to read or write correctly. worse still, forget religion & morality.

The modern tendencies seem to be to let out Nurses like Plumbers - for so many
hours a day to the Wards - Sisters or Head Nurses included - & then to let
them live for the remaining hours quite apart from the Hospital - wanting the
motherly element altogether - essential to a Nurse who is not a Plumber - but
has the care of soul & body in her Patients, & in her Assistant Nurses to
certify them as Plumbers. 2 to substitute the literary Nurse for the practical
Nurse who is to be raised by the moral side quite as much as by the technical
side - to have a spirit put into her quite as much as a hand.

Allowing for much exaggeration in this account, and knowing that Buonaparte
can still collect, in addition to what he has brought back with him, the 5th
corps d'arme`e, under Rapp, which is near Strasbourg, and the 3rd corps, which
was at Wavre during the battle, and has not suffered so much as the others,
