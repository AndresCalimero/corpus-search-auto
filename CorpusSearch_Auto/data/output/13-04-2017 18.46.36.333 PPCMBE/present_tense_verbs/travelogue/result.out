But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

divides the sea from wild commons all aglow with gorse and bracken, rolling
here into sand-hills where tufty, bent grass quivers precariously in the wind,
or sinking there into cuppy, sheltered hollows where sheep nibble upon soft
carpets of immemorial turf; while in the north the great mass of the Orme
rises grimly out of the sea from its encircling fringe of foam.

that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself

It really must be a fine thing to be Mayor of Conway; a different matter
altogether from presiding at the civic board of Pedlington-in-the-Marsh or
Smokeborough-on-Sea. To flaunt your robes and chains of office against such a
background as the panelled walls of Pla`s Mawr, and to pass in and out of your
domain beneath $heavy-browed feudal gateways. Above all, to be Constable, as
the Mayors of Conway are, of King Edward's stately pile, and do its honours to
deputations of learned and distinguished bodies, who in these particulars are
among the great ones of the earth.

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the

In speaking of the several Adventurers into the South Sea, we brought Sir
Francis Drake to the North Part of the Coast of Peru, whence he continu'd his
Course still Northward, out at Sea, without ever touching, or coming in Sight
of the Coast of New Spain, 'till the 5th of June 1578, when being in the
Latitude of 43 Degrees, and finding it very cold, he stood in for the Land,
which they tell us was not mountainous, and fell into a good Bay, in 38

Nor can, perhaps, the inhabitants of a rocky, arid, bleak, and naked region,
fancy a scene more enchanting, than is exhibited in a country of wide extent,
presenting throughout a smooth and equal surface, clothed with eternal verdure,
intersected by numberless deep and copious rivers, abounding with groves of
large and shady trees, and yielding an immense variety of fruits and flowers,
through every season of the year.
