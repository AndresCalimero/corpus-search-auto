The design of this and other like prophesies was to awaken that proud
luxurious people out of a state of unwarranted security - to make them
apprehensive of their real danger - to call off their trust from the arm of
flesh, from means merely human, their political wisdom and military power - to
direct their views to the Lord God of Hosts: to the end that they might feel
the necessity of humbling themselves under his mighty hand, and by the
reformation of their manners reconcile themselves to his favour, and engage
his protection.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

- Now all this may very well agree with the present supposition that this
transaction happened in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah. So that, on the whole,
we may consider the day, in which the Lord God of Hosts called the Jews to
repentance, not as a day of immediate trouble and distress, but rather as a
day of publick ease and security, and therefore a day of danger, of danger
more real and certain as being less suspected and foreseen, and, as such,
worthy of some extraordinary interposition.

This day of publick Humiliation if I may be allowed to apply the words of king
Hezekiah on a like occasion is to us a day of trouble, - of rebuke - and
blasphemy: - Of trouble, - as suggesting uneasy apprehensions of various
unknown dangers and difficulties, incident in the course of a long-continued
and far-extended war: of rebuke to our sanguine hopes, disappointment of our
premature expectations of victories, triumphs, and publick tranquillity: Of
blasphemy, - as affording matter of slander to our enemies from abroad, and of
complaint and murmurs at home.

Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

But the Question, whether we ought to love God for his Sake or for our own,
being a mere Mistake in Language; the real Question, which this is mistaken
for, will, I suppose, be answered by observing, that the Goodness of God
already exercised towards us, our present Dependance upon him, and our
Expectation of future Benefits, ought, and have a natural Tendency, to beget
in us the Affection of Gratitude, and greater Love towards Him, than the same
Goodness exercised towards others; were it only for this Reason, that every
Affection is moved in Proportion to the Sense we have of the Object of it;

Thus, then, I have endeavoured to point out that the course of things is so
arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another

But when we take a more practical view of the subject, and instead of looking
at the abstract character of these blessings, turn our attention to the real
change which they produce in our hearts and conduct; when we think of them not
as they ought to appear to us, but as they do, we are obliged to observe that,
in spite of all we know respecting God and His ways, we are nearly in all
respects the same persons as we should have been without this knowledge, and
that we should probably go on much in the same manner as we do, were our
religious creed no condition in the regulation of our conduct.

It will thus be seen that the advantage which may be derived from the
knowledge of the fact, has a necessary dependance on the habitual religious
condition of the persons to whom it is communicated; and that the process by
which we are to take advantage of it, is a discipline just of the same sort as
that which we undergo in forming virtuous habits; so that to create a strong
impression on the mind, far from being the object of the Dispensation,
scarcely enters into its design: and if in any instance it accidentally
effects this, yet that by so doing it no more fulfils its final purpose, than
the excitement of good impulses completes a virtuous character.

self-contempt,' 'self-mortification,' 'co-crucifixion with Christ,' of which
S. Paul speaks; nor again of contemplation, meditation on God or on Jesus and
His sufferings, communion with God, personal love for God, union with God, and
that continually growing; nor yet, once more, of God's being "a jealous God,"
jealous that the love to Him should not be parted between Him and His
creatures.

it; as also, that "in the last days" there would be "scoffers, walking after

Though far inferior to the Apostle in gifts, or knowledge of what may be the
designs of the Almighty; yet, as a veteran in your service, who feels daily
the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

But their supposing that Faith alone is to save men, without a suitable
Practice in the conduct of their lives, is as certainly an Error: which will
lead, and we see does lead some into the habitual practice of vice; from a
supposition that on account of their profession of Faith, they are secure of
happiness eternal, however they may behave; and which does lead others of
better disposition, into melancholy and despair, and thence too frequently
into absolute madness; from their not having presumption enough to pretend to
feel what they do not feel; or enthusiasm enough to fancy they feel an
assurance of their salvation, which frail man $can $not have.

when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated
there with next to divine honours.

destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly

Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

From the idea of the mass being a Sacrifice, has arisen the custom, so
scrupulously observed in these days, of attending mass celebrated by a Priest,

words pronounced.
