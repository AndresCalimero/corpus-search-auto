and yet we know that such is the case, because if, instead of taking a small
ivory ball, we take a mountain, and put a ball like this near it, we find that,
owing to the vast size of the mountain, as compared with the billiard ball,
the latter is drawn slightly towards it; showing clearly that an attraction
does exist, just as it did between the shell-lac which I rubbed and the piece

In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

It seems, therefore, fair to infer, that the same change of climate which has
caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the
Subapennine hills, now exclusively tropical, to retain no longer any
representatives in the adjoining seas, has also contributed to the
annihilation of certain genera of land-mammifera, which inhabited the
continents at about the same epoch.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

This maxim, that whatever the phial takes in at one surface it loses at the
other, led Dr. Franklin to think of charging several phials together with the
same trouble, by connecting the outside of one with the inside of another;
whereby the fluid that was driven out by the first would be received by the
second, and what was driven out of the second would be received by the third,

penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

Dr. Franklin, retaining the common opinion, that electrified bodies have real
atmospheres of the electric fluid consisting of particles at some distance
from the surface of the body, but always going along with it observed that
these atmospheres and the air did not seem to exclude one another; though, he
says, this be difficult to conceive, considering that they are generally
supposed to repel one another.

He observed, that a cork ball, electrified by a conductor from excited glass,
would be attracted by excited amber and sulphur, and repelled by excited glass
and china; that electrifying the ball with the wire of a charged phial, it
would be repelled by excited glass, but attracted by excited sulphur; and that
when he electrified it by sulphur or amber, till it became repelled by them,
it would be attracted by the wire of the phial, and repelled by its coating.

electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following

the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.
