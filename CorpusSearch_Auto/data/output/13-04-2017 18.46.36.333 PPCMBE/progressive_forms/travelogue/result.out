Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first
castle at Deganwy. A warlike person, but whose habits of life were so loose
that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

It really must be a fine thing to be Mayor of Conway; a different matter
altogether from presiding at the civic board of Pedlington-in-the-Marsh or
Smokeborough-on-Sea. To flaunt your robes and chains of office against such a
background as the panelled walls of Pla`s Mawr, and to pass in and out of your
domain beneath $heavy-browed feudal gateways. Above all, to be Constable, as
the Mayors of Conway are, of King Edward's stately pile, and do its honours to
deputations of learned and distinguished bodies, who in these particulars are

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the

Harbours, taken from the Spanish Coasting-Pilots, and other curious Cuts,
which, with several Curiosities, too tedious to be here taken Notice of, will
