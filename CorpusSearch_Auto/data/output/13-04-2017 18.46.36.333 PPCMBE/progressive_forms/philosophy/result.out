So whether fate is accomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of
providence, or by a soul, or by the service of all nature - whether by the
celestial motion of the stars, by the efficacy of angels, or by the many-sided
cunning of demons - whether by all or by some of these the destined series is
woven, this, at least, is manifest: that providence is the fixed and simple
form of destined events, fate their shifting series in order of time, as by
the disposal of the Divine simplicity they are to take place. Whereby it is
that all things which are under fate are subjected also to providence, on
which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain things which are set under
providence are above the chain of fate - viz, those things which by their
nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly fixed, and lie outside the
order of fate's movements.

I have been employed hitherto in proving that the power of the wicked, which
appeared to you the most shameful thing in the universe, is, in reality,
nothing; that their wickedness never escapes unpunished, punished,
notwithstanding the disagreeable idea you entertained to the contrary: that
their liberty to do evil, which you wished might soon come to an end, is not
of long duration: that the longer it continues, they are so much the more
miserable; and that if it were to continue for ever, their misery would be
infinite: that, in fine, if the wicked escaped by an unjust exemption from
punishment, they would be more unhappy than if they were chastised according
to their demerits; and consequently, that they are never more rigorously
punished, than when they are supposed not to suffer for their crimes,

Destiny operates, or by a soul, or by the ministry of the whole frame of
nature, or by the influence of the stars, or by the power of angels, or the
unwearied industry of demons; or whether it be by any one of these things, or
by all of them together, that the chain of Destiny is formed; it is evident
Providence is the invariable, the simple, and uncompounded train of conducting
