So far, my aim hath been to make thee recognize that the power of the bad
which shocked thee so exceedingly is no power; to make thee see that those of
whose freedom from punishment thou didst complain are never without the proper
penalties of their unrighteousness; to teach thee that the licence which thou
prayedst might soon come to an end is not long-enduring; that it would be more
unhappy if it lasted longer, most unhappy of all if it lasted for ever;
thereafter that the unrighteous are more wretched if unjustly let go without
punishment than if punished by a just retribution - from which point of view
it follows that the wicked are afflicted with more severe penalties just when
they are supposed to escape punishment. '

I have been employed hitherto in proving that the power of the wicked, which
appeared to you the most shameful thing in the universe, is, in reality,
nothing; that their wickedness never escapes unpunished, punished,
notwithstanding the disagreeable idea you entertained to the contrary: that
their liberty to do evil, which you wished might soon come to an end, is not
of long duration: that the longer it continues, they are so much the more
miserable; and that if it were to continue for ever, their misery would be
infinite: that, in fine, if the wicked escaped by an unjust exemption from
punishment, they would be more unhappy than if they were chastised according
to their demerits; and consequently, that they are never more rigorously
punished, than when they are supposed not to suffer for their crimes,
