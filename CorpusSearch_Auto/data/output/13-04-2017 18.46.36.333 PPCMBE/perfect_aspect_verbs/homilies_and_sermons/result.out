But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

It seems that Sennacherib had, upon advice that Hirhakah King of Ethiopia was
come forth to make war with him, for awhile withdrawn his powers from Judea,
and marched out to give him battle: and having then defeated the allied army,
on which the Jews had placed no small confidence, he resumed his attempt upon
Jerusalem.

disinterested views: - or whether they are not influenced by resentment and

Thus, then, I have endeavoured to point out that the course of things is so
arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another

To go even farther, one may state, that even such persons as have been blessed
by nature with moderate passions and desires, such as are disposed of their
own accord to kindness, sobriety, seriousness of mind, even these persons have
need to "exercise" themselves, - to pass such lives as require industry and
patience, - almost as much as others of less favoured temper, in whom the
effects of self-indulgence would be more obvious and offensive.

But when we take a more practical view of the subject, and instead of looking
at the abstract character of these blessings, turn our attention to the real
change which they produce in our hearts and conduct; when we think of them not
as they ought to appear to us, but as they do, we are obliged to observe that,
in spite of all we know respecting God and His ways, we are nearly in all
respects the same persons as we should have been without this knowledge, and
that we should probably go on much in the same manner as we do, were our
religious creed no condition in the regulation of our conduct.

in order "that no flesh should glory in His Presence," so He allowed man's
keenest intelligence, and strongest moral power, the instruments which He had
Himself formed in the natural order of things, to try their utmost and fail,

And no greater service that I know of has been rendered of late to the belief
in the inspiration of Scripture, and in the revelation which is unfolded to us
therein, than was the publication from an Assyrian source, of an account of
creation, plainly akin to that of Genesis, but with this vital and revealing
difference, that in it the gods are an output of chaos; while in Genesis, "In

beyond our tracing, and in a manner past our finding out, seems to speak in

and to have gradually unfolded from within, the depths and truths of its own

This Epistle therefore may be considered as a farewell to those who had
embraced Christianity; to exhort them to continue stedfast in the practice as
well as the profession of it: warning them of false teachers who would arise
in the bosom of the Church of Christ, and introduce erroneous doctrines into
it; as also, that "in the last days" there would be "scoffers, walking after
their own lusts;" who would blaspheme and deride Christianity, and set it at
nought.

Though far inferior to the Apostle in gifts, or knowledge of what may be the
designs of the Almighty; yet, as a veteran in your service, who feels daily
the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

I mean, the being of a God; his creation of the whole world; and his
providential care of it, and of every individual in it: the Revelations he has
made of himself and of his will to mankind; to Adam, to the Patriarchs, to the
Israelites or Jews by Moses, and last of all by Jesus Christ his Son; whom he
sent in the nature and form of mortal man, to redeem mankind from sin and from
death; to proclaim pardon to us all, on repentance and amendment of life; to
assure us, through faith in him, of a resurrection to eternal life; and to
eternal happiness in that life, provided we exert our endeavors to live in
obedience to his commands during our continuance here; and with a promise,
that we shall receive the assistance of God's holy Spirit, if we seek and ask
it, to help our infirmities, and enable us to do what He expects us to strive
to perform.

Though our endeavors have been to obviate the mischievous spreading of the
works of a voluminous French writer; who manifestly not from principle or

foundation of Revelation; little could it be imagined that the day would come,
when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.
