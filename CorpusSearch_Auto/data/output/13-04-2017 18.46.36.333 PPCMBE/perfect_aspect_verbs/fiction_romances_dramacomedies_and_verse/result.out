confidential manner.

Had I taken a small Vessel from England, and went directly to the Island; had
I loaded her, as I did the other Vessel, with all the Necessaries for the
Plantation, and for my People took a Patent from the Governour here, to have
secur'd my Property, in Subjection only to that of England; had I carried over
Cannon and Ammunition, Servants and People, to plant, and taking Possession of
the Place, fortified and strengthen'd it in the Name of England, and increas'd
it with People, as I might easily have done; had I then settl'd my self there,
and sent the Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I might also have done in
six Months time, and order'd my Friends to have fitted her out, again for our
Supply; had I done this, and staid there my self, I had, at least, acted like
a Man of common sense;

but as I rambled from them, and came there no more, the last Letters I had
from any of them, was by my Partner's Means; who afterwards sent another Sloop
to the Place, and who sent me Word, tho' I had not the Letter till five Years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly, were malecontent with
their long Stay there. That Will. Atkins was dead: That five of the Spaniards
were come away, and that tho' they had not been much molested by the Savages,
yet they had some Skirmishes with them; that they begged of him to write to me,
to think of the Promise I had made, to fetch them away, that they might see
their own Country again before they dy'd.

Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by
his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he
could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling
and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding
both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them
by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr Pickwick from his
sleep.

This Gentleman then being well tired with his long Journey from Chester in one
Day, with which, and some good dry Blows he had received in the Scuffle, his
Bones were so sore, that added to the soreness of his Mind, it had quite
deprived him of any Appetite for eating. And being now so violently
disappointed in the Woman whom, at the Maid's Instance, he had mistaken for
his Wife, it never once entered into his Head that she might nevertheless be
in the House, though he had erred in the first Person he had attacked.

of his hand and title to the strange girl in a quadrille at a foreign castle
had been forgotten by her, and the risks of annoyance on the subject had quite
blown over, returned to town, happy in having done the penance for his
impulsiveness, and got clean again - that is to say, struck off his fetters
