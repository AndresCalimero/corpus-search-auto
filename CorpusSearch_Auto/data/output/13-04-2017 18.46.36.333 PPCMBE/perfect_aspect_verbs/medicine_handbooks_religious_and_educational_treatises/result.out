Let as many Children as you please, when they are just learning to speak or if
they have learn'd a few English Words, they will quickly forget them be kept
in such a Place, where they $can $not Converse with any but those who speak
Latin; which need be no great Confinement to them, considering how many Places
of this Nature there are, where they may live with great Liberty, Pleasure and
Satisfaction.

admire and love in Virgil, it is probably he and not Virgil that needs to be
changed.

Though it may tend to increase it, and often concurs with other causes at sea
to render it highly virulent; yet it is certain, the scurvy appears most
frequently where such food has no share in breeding it, however generally it
has been accused; its most common occasional cause being the gross viscid diet
before described.

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

With a fuller knowledge of the distinctive characteristics of the many
beautiful trees, shrubs, &c., that had been introduced from Japan, and the
increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the various phases of garden
design that had long found favour in that country, it is not surprising that a
strong desire should have been felt by many owners of gardens within the
British Isles to create gardens more or less in accordance with Japanese ideas.

stammer over a Chapter in the Bible, and before he has well lost the uncouth
Tone of Pronunciation, which he has perhaps learnt of his Mistress, he is
immediately sent to the Latin School; where, instead of studying his own

distinctly, and with proper Emphasis, he is unreasonably enter'd upon a Latin

be also fitly prepar'd for the Study of other Languages, more especially the
Latin, the Difficulty of which will, by that Means, be in a great Measure

But, as some Persons may be engag'd in Business, wherein is very little Use of
this Science, by which Means they may be liable to forget what they had
learn'd; and others may be so hastily enter'd upon what may very much require
it, as not to have Time to obtain a sufficient Knowledge therein, I sometime
ago publish'd a little Treatise, in a neat Pocket Volume, under the Title of
Arithmetick in Epitome, or, a Compendium of all its Rules, both Vulgar and
Decimal. Which Book, as it was chiefly intended, and, at first, particularly
dedicated to the ingenious Clerks and Accomptants of the several Offices of
Great Britain, so it has so far had the good Fortune to please, as to have
already past two Impressions.

civilisation; which question, as we have seen, may be decided, by inquiring

Upon the decision of that question may depend, whether Europe, and America,
which must follow the intellectual fortunes of Europe, shall, for the next
thousand years, be in the condition of the later Greeks and Romans, having for
their mental aristocracy, a class of philosophical system-builders,
commentators, and mere metaphysicians; or shall go on to exhibit that healthy
vigour and constant effort at real progress and improvement, which has
characterized this quarter of the globe for the last three hundred years.

This idea, too, has now been communicated to persons of education in general,
as the general reception of the Newtonian theory of the universe proves; while,
at the same time, the very indistinct views which men of considerable
cultivation often entertain of the mechanism of the universe, proves that the
fundamental ideas on which a clear apprehension of the doctrine of universal
attraction depends, have hitherto been very imperfectly diffused through the

the reader who merely flutters through a series of authors such as catch his

receive from them such a culture as we have supposed; any more than from any
