above two years, since he, in a most ungentlemanly manner to use no worse word

prevail; my father having first told me that he would take no part in the
election.

When we consider, in what height of the Nation's Prosperity, the Successor of
Queen Elizabeth came to this Throne, it seems amazing, that such a Pile of
English Fame and Glory, which her skilful Administration had erected, should,
in every following Reign, down to the Revolution, so unhappily moulder away,
in one continual Gradation of Political Errors: All which must have been
avoided, if the plain Rule, which that wise Princess left behind her, had been
observed, viz. That the Love of her People was the surest Support of her

Now to give you, Sir, a farther Proof of how good a Taste my first hopeful
Entrance into Manhood set out with, I remember above twenty Years after, when
the same Lady had given the World four of the loveliest Daughters that ever
were gaz'd on, even after they were all nobly married, and were become the
reigning Toasts of every Party of Pleasure, their still lovely Mother had at
the same time her Votaries, and her Health very often took the Lead, in those
involuntary Triumphs of Beauty.

That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

But the Major was so little affected with what had befallen him, that when
some of his gay Friends, on hearing the Story, rallied him upon the Efficacy
of his Prayers, he excused himself from the scandal of being thought much in
earnest, by saying, "That it was at Midnight, an Hour when his good Mother and
Aunt were asleep; or else he should have left that Part of the Business to
them." A Speech, which I should not have mentioned, but as it shews in so
lively a view the wretch'd Situation of his Mind at that Time, though his
great Deliverance from the Power of Darkness was then nearly approaching.

"Yea, I have known those of distinguished Genius, polite Manners, and great
Experience in Human Affairs, who, after having outgrown all the Impressions of
a Religious Education; after having been hardned, rather than subdued, by the
most singular Mercies, even various, repeated, and astonishing Deliverances,
which have appeared to themselves as no less than miraculous; after having
lived for Years without God in the world, notoriously corrupt themselves, and
labouring to the utmost to corrupt others, have been stopt on a sudden in the
full Career of their Sin, and have felt such Rays of the Divine Presence, and
of Redeeming Love, darting in upon their Minds, almost like Lightning from
Heaven, as have at once rouzed, over-powered, and transformed them: So that
they have come out of their Secret Chambers with an irreconcilable Enmity to
those Vices, to which, when they entered them, they were the tamest and most
abandoned Slaves; and have appeared from that very Hour the Votaries, the
Patrons, the Champions of Religion;

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

I should have at once considered the waters of the Lac de Chede to be
cupriferous, had it not been for their excessive clearness, and for the
presence of numerous water serpents, one of which we caught as it was twisting
about among the grass and reeds near the shore, holding its head well above
water. About 14 inches long I believe there are some nearly a yard, belly
yellow, back yellow with green chequers, head green with a yellow ring round
its neck, and two black triangular spots on the ring with their points
directed down the back.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.

Canning who had gone to India most unwillingly in obedience to Palmerston's
commands, the Canning to have said a word against whom required the
self-annihilation of a Minister, Canning who completed by his death his
victory in the country he had been sent to govern, - to him and to those brave
men whom the Mutiny, bursting from its swarthy ranks, had found in India, the
first praise for crushing it is due.
