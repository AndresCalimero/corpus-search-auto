and from thence the Rear-Admiral would infer, the losing of his Maintop-Mast
as a Consequence. 2. That so soon as I had got clear of the Cornwal's
Weather-Quarter I luffed up, and fell upon the Cornwal's Weather-Bow. 3. That
I luffed up a second Time, when the Warwick was coming up. 4. That I was
ordered to bear down upon the Enemy just after the Cornwal withdrew; but that
I did not do so as I ought to have done, notwithstanding those Orders. 5. That
I fired upon the Strafford so long and so obstinately, that I did her great
Mischief; Altho' I had been several Times hailed by her. 6. And in general
that my Behaviour had been very bad during the Course of the Action, except

Sir, We humbly conceive it is our Duty to represent to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that in the Action between his Majesty's Squadron, and that
of Spain, which happened on the first of Octob. 1748, near the Havanna, that
by Rear-Admiral Knowles's bad Conduct, mistaken Signals, and $Un-Officerlike
Attack, he gave great Advantage to the Enemy; by engaging in a straggling Line
a superior Squadron drawn up in a close Line of Battle, late in the Day, when
he might have attacked them much earlier, and to greater Advantage. That his
Majesty's Ship Cornwal was not in the Action an Hour. That to the great
Dishonour of the British Flag, Rear-Admiral Knowles, not only unnecessarily
carried, but kept his Majesty's Flag out of Action. That he has endeavoured to
deceive his Majesty, their Lordships, and the Publick, by having transmitted a
false and injurious Account of the said Action, to Mr. Corbet, by Letter of
the 2d of October 1748; all which we are ready to prove,

I have sometimes thought that the real test of a schoolmaster or mistress
would be whether the children go on after they have left school liking to
inform themselves, liking to observe, liking to read up a thing: or whether
they forget all they have been taught, never to open a book, and even forget
how to read or write correctly. worse still, forget religion & morality.

3 Among all the country girls still in their teens, whom I have known or
taught, and who had been probably for 8 years at elementary schools, I have
never known one who knew, or wished to know, the names of trees or of flowers,
or plants, not even of the commonest wildflowers they might know a Rose nor of
the common birds when they saw them, nor of what made it possible for birds to
fly, nor of any of those common things which they had been seeing every day of
their lives.

My dear Sir Most heartily do I give you joy on the success of your 'Health at
Home' Education Mission - the enthusiastic attendance on your Lectures of
rural educated women from all over the County allowed to attend for their own
profit - your sifting & re-sifting till you obtained a Class of 12, who
appeared willing & able to become instructresses or missioners of Health to
the uneducated rural women at their own homes - the object of the whole course
being the new one not simply to give Sanitary information but to teach how to
teach - the examination by an independent well-known Sanitary authority - both
in writing & by word of mouth to test their power of speaking to the
uneducated And six of them passing the Exam'n with the utmost success three
indeed above what had been expected. the main object of the Exam'n being to
see not only if their book knowledge or theory were competent but if they
could give in the most practical & plainest, in the most lively & dramatic
manner - their knowledge to uneducated women in their own houses - translate
in fact the object-lessons they had received from your skill & kindness in the
worst houses of the worst villages - into the cottage life with their own
hands & tongue.

I am convinced that the penetration of your Highness will have shown you the
danger of all these schemes to the interests of the Emperor; and that you will

find us likewise which will finally lead to the establishment in France of the
legitimate Government, from which alone Europe can expect any genuine peace.
