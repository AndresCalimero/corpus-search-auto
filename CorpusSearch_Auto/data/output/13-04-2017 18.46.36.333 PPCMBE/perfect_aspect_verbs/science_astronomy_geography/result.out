This is one of the house Spiders, whose vertues are excellent in the cure of
intermitting fevers, when the bark and other remedies have failed, as I have
often experienced on several, both old and young; the use of which I will now
publish for the benefit of the poor and country people, who are remote from
the help of physicians.

By this method I have cured many people of stubborn and long continu'd tertian,
quartan, and quotidian Fevers, particularly some of the servants of the
Honourable Colonel Schutz, when their taking the Bark for a long time failed:
as also Dame Hughs of Tottenham-Court Road of a tertian Ague of three years
continuance, with many others.

age, perhaps the first sight of a cataract or a mountain would occasion him
more surprise than he had ever felt concerning the means of his own existence;
how he came here; how he lives; by what means he stands upright; and through
what means he moves about from place to place.

different kinds of matter, subject to a very few powers; and all disposed in
this strange and wonderful way, which gives to man a history - and such a
history - as to what there is in those veins, in those rocks, the ores, the
water springs, the atmosphere around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of forces in one great mass, 8000 miles in diameter,

In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

As a belief in want of conformity in the physical constitution of the earth,
in ancient and modern times, was for a long time universally prevalent, and
that too amongst men who were convinced that the order of nature is now
uniform, and has continued so for several thousand years; every circumstance
which could have influenced their minds and given an undue bias to their

If, when these enquiries were first made, geologists had been told that the
mode of formation of such rocks might be fully elucidated by the study of
processes then going on in certain parts of the Mediterranean, they would have
been as incredulous as geometers would have been before the time of Newton, if
any one had informed them that, by making experiments on the motion of bodies
on the earth, they might discover the laws which regulated the movements of

In regard to the signs of upraising and sinking, of fracture and contortion in
rocks, it is evident that newer strata $can $not be shaken by earthquakes,
unless the subjacent rocks are also affected; so that the contrast in the
relative degree of disturbance in the more ancient and the newer strata, is
one of many proofs that the convulsions have happened in different eras, and
the fact confirms the uniformity of the action of subterranean forces, instead
of their greater violence in the primeval ages.

It seems, therefore, fair to infer, that the same change of climate which has
caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the
Subapennine hills, now exclusively tropical, to retain no longer any
representatives in the adjoining seas, has also contributed to the
annihilation of certain genera of land-mammifera, which inhabited the
continents at about the same epoch.

Though the English have not been backward in acknowledging the great merit of
this philosopher, he has had the singular good fortune to be, perhaps, even
more celebrated abroad than at home; so that to form a just idea of the great

on the subject of electricity; in many of which the terms Franklinism,
Franklinist, and the Franklinian system occur in almost every page.

He says, that when a tube lined with any non-electric is rubbed, what is
collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

He also says, that when the gilding was varnished even with turpentine, this
varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was

penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

As I have drawn it here Fig. 1, it is implied that the tension of the
water-air surface is less than the sum of the other two tensions - those of
the water-oil surface and the air-oil surface; because the two latter acting
obliquely balance the former.
