Of the former sort is that which is convey'd to an attentive considerate mind
in the common dispensations of God's Providence; where the notoriety of the
case it self, as it points out the interposition of the finger of God, does
withal suggest the moral duties required of men in such circumstances: so that
when God's judgments are seen in the earth the inhabitants may learn
righteousness.

Now concerning the manner of the divine Call it may be remarked: that in
proportion to the notoriety of the Call, or the extraordinary circumstances,
by which the delivery of it is attended, being such as are best suited to
excite mens regard and command their reverence; I say, in proportion to the
means of conviction thus offered, mens inattention, irreverence and
disobedience receive additional degrees of aggravation, and subject them to
the more severe inflictions of the divine judgments.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

on which the Jews had placed no small confidence, he resumed his attempt upon
Jerusalem.

- Now all this may very well agree with the present supposition that this
transaction happened in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah. So that, on the whole,
we may consider the day, in which the Lord God of Hosts called the Jews to
repentance, not as a day of immediate trouble and distress, but rather as a
day of publick ease and security, and therefore a day of danger, of danger
more real and certain as being less suspected and foreseen, and, as such,
worthy of some extraordinary interposition.

Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

being a mere Mistake in Language; the real Question, which this is mistaken

already exercised towards us, our present Dependance upon him, and our
Expectation of future Benefits, ought, and have a natural Tendency, to beget
in us the Affection of Gratitude, and greater Love towards Him, than the same
Goodness exercised towards others; were it only for this Reason, that every

arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another

But when we take a more practical view of the subject, and instead of looking
at the abstract character of these blessings, turn our attention to the real
change which they produce in our hearts and conduct; when we think of them not
as they ought to appear to us, but as they do, we are obliged to observe that,
in spite of all we know respecting God and His ways, we are nearly in all
respects the same persons as we should have been without this knowledge, and
that we should probably go on much in the same manner as we do, were our
religious creed no condition in the regulation of our conduct.

It will thus be seen that the advantage which may be derived from the
knowledge of the fact, has a necessary dependance on the habitual religious
condition of the persons to whom it is communicated; and that the process by
which we are to take advantage of it, is a discipline just of the same sort as
that which we undergo in forming virtuous habits; so that to create a strong
impression on the mind, far from being the object of the Dispensation,
scarcely enters into its design: and if in any instance it accidentally
effects this, yet that by so doing it no more fulfils its final purpose, than
the excitement of good impulses completes a virtuous character.

I have not spoken of any of the austerer graces, 'self-revenge,' '
self-contempt,' 'self-mortification,' 'co-crucifixion with Christ,' of which
S. Paul speaks; nor again of contemplation, meditation on God or on Jesus and
His sufferings, communion with God, personal love for God, union with God, and
that continually growing; nor yet, once more, of God's being "a jealous God,"
jealous that the love to Him should not be parted between Him and His

Their noble open-heartedness appeals to many who do not see deeper; who do not
recognize what strong and illuminating moral power is required to open the
heart to such steady and impartial admiration of that which is good, true, and
pure; what ready conscience and controlled attention is needed to 'think on
these things,' as the Apostle would understand thinking; and how far apart is
the admiration which really ennobles and constrains the heart from the languid
sentiment which may only leave us, as it passes, one degree more callous.

This Epistle therefore may be considered as a farewell to those who had
embraced Christianity; to exhort them to continue stedfast in the practice as
well as the profession of it: warning them of false teachers who would arise
in the bosom of the Church of Christ, and introduce erroneous doctrines into
it; as also, that "in the last days" there would be "scoffers, walking after
their own lusts;" who would blaspheme and deride Christianity, and set it at
nought.

to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

I mean, the being of a God; his creation of the whole world; and his
providential care of it, and of every individual in it: the Revelations he has
made of himself and of his will to mankind; to Adam, to the Patriarchs, to the
Israelites or Jews by Moses, and last of all by Jesus Christ his Son; whom he
sent in the nature and form of mortal man, to redeem mankind from sin and from
death; to proclaim pardon to us all, on repentance and amendment of life; to
assure us, through faith in him, of a resurrection to eternal life; and to
eternal happiness in that life, provided we exert our endeavors to live in
obedience to his commands during our continuance here; and with a promise,
that we shall receive the assistance of God's holy Spirit, if we seek and ask
it, to help our infirmities, and enable us to do what He expects us to strive
to perform.

But their supposing that Faith alone is to save men, without a suitable
Practice in the conduct of their lives, is as certainly an Error: which will
lead, and we see does lead some into the habitual practice of vice; from a
supposition that on account of their profession of Faith, they are secure of
happiness eternal, however they may behave; and which does lead others of
better disposition, into melancholy and despair, and thence too frequently
into absolute madness; from their not having presumption enough to pretend to
feel what they do not feel; or enthusiasm enough to fancy they feel an

Indeed against them, it is proper from time to time to caution mankind:
because that is a corruption of Christianity expressly pointed out by Prophecy,
as what was to arise in the Church of Christ, and what is to continue for a
certain specific term and no longer: a corrupt Church, from whose Communion
God's "people" are exhorted to "come out" before its destruction; for that it
should come to an end and be destroyed with a signal destruction before the
coming of Christ to judgement.

Though our endeavors have been to obviate the mischievous spreading of the
works of a voluminous French writer; who manifestly not from principle or
conviction, but merely for the sake of applause, had been sapping the
foundation of Revelation; little could it be imagined that the day would come,
when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated
there with next to divine honours.

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

But, as I told you in one of those discourses, so it may be proper to repeat
that now, The great distinction between the Church of Rome and those who
protested, was at that time, and continues to this day, and ought for ever to
be kept in remembrance by those who call themselves Protestants; that the
Papist or Roman Catholic, derives the rule of Faith and Practice from the
Decrees of his Church; the Protestant, from the word of God alone.
