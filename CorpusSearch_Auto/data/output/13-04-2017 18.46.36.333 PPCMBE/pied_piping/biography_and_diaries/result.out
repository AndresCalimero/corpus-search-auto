Now to give you, Sir, a farther Proof of how good a Taste my first hopeful
Entrance into Manhood set out with, I remember above twenty Years after, when
the same Lady had given the World four of the loveliest Daughters that ever
were gaz'd on, even after they were all nobly married, and were become the
reigning Toasts of every Party of Pleasure, their still lovely Mother had at
the same time her Votaries, and her Health very often took the Lead, in those
involuntary Triumphs of Beauty.

From Nottingham I again return'd to my Father at Chattsworth, where I staid
till my Lord came down, with the new Honours of Duke of Devonshire, Lord
Steward of his Majesty's Houshold, and Knight of the Garter! a noble turn of
Fortune! and a deep Stake he had play'd for! which calls to my Memory a Story
we had then in the Family, which though too light for our graver Historians
notice, may be of weight enough for my humble Memoirs.

That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

To these laudable Distinctions let me add one more; that of Publick Applause,
which, when truly merited, is perhaps, one of the most agreeable
Gratifications that venial Vanity can feel. A Happiness almost peculiar to the
Actor, insomuch that the best Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate
Admirers may be, yet, to unite them into one general Act of Praise, to receive
at once, those thundring Peals of Approbation, which a crouded Theatre throws
out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor, to raise and
partake of them.

Not to dwell too long therefore upon that Part of my History, which I have
only collected, from oral Tradition, I shall content my self with telling you
that Mohun, and Hart now growing old for, above thirty Years before this Time,
they had severally born the King's Commission of Major and Captain, in the
Civil Wars, and the younger Actors, as Goodman, Clark, and others, being
impatient to get into their Parts, and growing intractable, the Audiences too
of both Houses then falling off, the Patentees of each, by the King's Advice,
which perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests, and both
Companies into one, exclusive of all others, in the Year 1684.

of Colonel Gardiner will invite many of our Officers and Soldiers, to whom his
Name has long been honourable and dear, to peruse this Account of him with
some peculiar Attention: In Consequence of which, it may be a Means of
increasing the Number, and brightening the Character, of those who are already

A.D. 1687-8, the memorable Year of that glorious Revolution which he justly
esteem'd among the happiest of all Events. So that, when he was slain in the
Defence of those Liberties, which God then by so gracious a Providence rescued
from utter Destruction, i.e. on the 21st of September 1745, he was aged 57
Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days.

And which I think deserves particular Remark though he assuredly believed that
he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,
and to that Blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a Manner set forth

high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very

Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and

streets of Dublin unremarked, in the old dress, worn in the days of Charles
the Second; a large cocked hat, all on one side his face, nearly covering his
left eye; a great powdered wig, hanging at the side in curls, and in the
centre at the back a large black cockade, with a small drop curl from it; his
embroidered waistcoat down to his knees; the top of his coat not within three
inches of his neck, the hip buttons about a foot from it; buttons all the way
down the coat, but only one at the waist buttoned; the hilt of the sword
through the opening of the skirt; a long cravat, fringed, the end pulled
through the third button-hole; small buckles; the coat sleeves very short, and
the shirt sleeves pulled down, but hid by the top of the gloves, and the
ruffles hanging out at the opening of the cuff; the waistcoat entirely open
except the lower button, displaying the finely plaited frill.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

the consent of the traders to that sea, Denmark taking upon itself the charge
of constructing lighthouses, and erecting signals, to mark the shoals and
rocks from the Cattegat to the Baltic: and they, on their part, agreeing that
all ships should pass this way, in order that all might pay their shares: none
from that time using the passage of the Belt; because it was not fitting that
they, who enjoyed the benefit of the beacons in dark and stormy weather,
should evade contributing to them in fair seasons and summer nights.

found many of the mangled and mutilated Danes bleeding to death for want of
proper assistance - a scene, of all others, the most shocking to a brave man's

Bradley's paper was very good, excepting from the one fatal defect to me its
chief merit, that he did not realise the least the deadly character of his own
admissions against hostels, and proceeds at the end to suggest improvements.

if it $can $not be helped, to have them with eyes opened as being the best
that can be got, instead of whitewashing the sepulchre.

We decided to drop Greek entirely in the three lowest classes, with a view of
getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.

either committed or pretended, than that of calling Sinners to Repentance.
