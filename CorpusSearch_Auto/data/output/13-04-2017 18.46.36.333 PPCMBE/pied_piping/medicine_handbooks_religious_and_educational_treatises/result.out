It is evident by Experience, that there are several Arts and Sciences, which
$can $not be learn'd in any great Perfection, without the Knowledge of Latin,
or Greek, or other Antient Languages. Upon which Account it must be confess'd,
that those Persons. who design to Study such Arts or Sciences, ought to be
very well acquainted with these Languages; seeing an imperfect Knowledge of
them, only serves for Ostentation amongst the Ignorant, but is of no great
real use or Advantage.

I am told that the Restorers of Polite Learning in Italy, had a Project of
Making the Latin Tongue by Conversation, the Vulgar Language of the Country,
and that they carry'd their Design so far, that in a great many Places, Latin
was commonly spoke, instead of Italian: Which if true, is a plain Argument,
that Latin may be taught by Conversation.

For since Men who know little or nothing of French, Italian, or Spanish,
quickly learn any one of these Languages, only by going twice or thrice a Week
to a Club, where they are oblig'd to speak it; we may reasonably think that
Men wou'd learn Latin after the same Method, and almost with the same Ease

If after all, it shou'd be objected that the School-Masters themselves are
forc'd to have frequent Recourse to Grammar, in order to satisfy themselves in
many Cases what is, or is not, true Latin, and consequently, that they $can
$not warrant the Trueness of a Latin Conversation: I answer, That I take it to
be undoubtedly certain, that he, who can correct Latin when it is writ as all
School-masters do their Boy's Exercises can correct it when it is spoke.

in what familiar method he proposes to convey the first principles into the
minds of children; whether he thinks they may be taught any thing besides
Greek and Latin, if such knowledge be universally necessary, and how far the
rules and expressions of the English language are to be regarded at a
grammar-school; at what time a boy should read the poets, if promiscuously
with the historians, or if they would not rather be a mutual hindrance, from
their different manner and expression; if it is possible to inspire youth with
any thing like taste, or when and in what way such a thing is to be acquired.

It will be proper to premise, that I mean to include under the term chronic
rheumatism, such painful affections of the muscular fibres, membranes, and
joints as are unattended with fever, specific virus, or peculiar derangement
of the stomach and bowels; and which are seldom accompanied with external
tumor or inflammation, but are very liable to shift suddenly from one part to
another, and are readily propagated along the course of the membranes and
muscular fibres.

exerted upon immature minds is not in itself more cramping than none at all,

of Commencing with an English Education would be a great Benefit to our Youth,
whether continued, or taken off from School; to Adult Persons, that have
forgot or never had School-Learning any farther than to Read; since by the
help of an English Grammar and Rhetoric they may arrive to no small
Accomplishments both in Speaking and Writing.

spirit, to pursue a path, which is no less hazardous than it is honourable.

No Man can pretend to enter upon Business, before he rightly understands a
distinct Method of keeping his Accompts in such Order, as at any Time he can
satisfy himself and every Person with whom he trades, how the State of Affairs
stands betwixt them. Also, how he has disposed of such Goods, Houses, Ships,
or other Effects, which he had either purchased, or were left to him: Whereby
he knows to whom he is Debtor, or who are Debtors to him.

an artificial transplanting of those trees, just the same as though they were

whereby the seminal principles concentred in the seed, or contracted into
those prolific buds, are put into their proper matrix, which, with other
requisites concurring, are set into their vegetative spring, or fermental

&c. are in fact nothing more than the evident indexes of the action of the
seminal principles of those inoculated buds, which being set into motion, by
requisites duly concurring admit of the juice or sap of the bole, and becomes
fermental, dashing the preconceived seminal tincture of the stock, whereby it
was disposed to the putting on the form of a plum tree transmutes that juice
into its own nature, and so from the intestine strugglings of the said seminal
principles of the inoculated bud, proceeds the vegetation and growth of the

cherries, such as the Flanders kind, hart, duke, &c. put into wild or black
cherry stocks, by which means in two or three years they become fruit-bearing
trees, which if raised from the stones, or propagated from suckers, would not
come to pass till after many more;

In a spontaneous salivation; or, as is much oftener the case, when a copious
spitting has unfortunately been induced by some mercurial medicine, where
immediate danger is apprehended, speedy revulsion must be made from the
salivary glands, by epispastics applied to different parts of the body,
sinapisms to the soles of the feet and hams; and by opening the belly with
glysters, and such gentle purgatives as operate only in the first passages.

in the Month of June to kill the Drones of an Hive, and has continued so to do,
from Day to Day, until he could find no more to kill; and that he was very
positive, that few, if any, escaped his Knife, and that yet, that Hive was as
forward and Thriving next Spring as any other, whence it may be concluded,
that another Father, than the Drones, must be found out, for the next Year's

It seems probable that the association of movement is effected by ganglia,
which are common to fibres passing through distinct but contiguous
nerve-trunks, and that it is owing to some nutrition change in them - the
result of persevering and forced effort - that the perfection of movement is
produced;

But if you compare symptoms and circumstances together, to account for, if
possible, the cause of complaint; if the Horse has been well kept,
consequently full of flesh, and little or no work; for I do not call walking a
Horse about to stretch his limbs which lazy grooms will do, and are afraid of
sweating them, because of the trouble of cleaning them, sufficient to keep a
Horse in health; you may reasonably conclude, the blood-vessels are prevented
from performing their natural functions, and evacuations must relieve them.

in order, then to guard the inexperienced against impositions of this sort, it
will be necessary to apprise such, that a colt is foaled without teeth; in a
few days, he puts out four, which are called pincers, or nippers; soon after,
appear the four separators, next to the nippers; it is sometimes three or four
months before the next, called the corner teeth, push forth; these twelve
colt's teeth, in the front of the mouth, continue without alternation, till
the colt is two years and a half old, which makes it difficult, without great
care, to avoid being imposed upon during that interval, if the seller finds it
his interest to make the colt pass for either younger or older than he really
is; the only rule you then have to judge by is his coat, and the hairs of his
mane and tail.

innumerable pipes and vessels are contrived, as so many canals, through which

The blood being constantly propelled towards the excretory pores of the skin,
by the constant dilation and contraction of the arteries, is the cause of
perspiration; besides which, there is an internal heat, or rarifying virtue,
that expands the fluids, opens the pores, and resolves moisture into exceeding
fine vapours, from which it is easy to infer, that the greater the force is,
by which the blood or humours are driven to the surface of the body of any
animal, the more copious perspiration will be, unless prevented by the
stoppage of the pores;

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

This work on commercial gardening deals principally with those classes of
plants that are grown in large quantities either in the open air or under
glass for sale in the London and provincial markets, and also those that are
grown by nurserymen and hardy-plantsmen in fairly large numbers to meet the
demands of their customers who do not patronize the markets.

beautiful trees, shrubs, &c., that had been introduced from Japan, and the
increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the various phases of garden
design that had long found favour in that country, it is not surprising that a
strong desire should have been felt by many owners of gardens within the
British Isles to create gardens more or less in accordance with Japanese ideas.

One of the principal rules governing the work of the landscape gardener in
Japan is to follow nature as far as is practicable, and to arrange the
arborescent and other forms of plant life in their natural associations. That
is to say, plants which in a state of nature have their home on the mountain
side are not to be brought down to those parts of the garden which represent
the lowlands, and, it may be, used in the formation of a flowery fringe to
running stream or silent pool.

Is it not strange then, that an Accomplishment so advantagious and necessary,
should be so much slighted and neglected, as that perhaps of fifty British
Youths put out to Business absolutely requiring it, scarce one shall be found
therein fitly qualify'd? Upon which Account the Parents are not only oblig'd
to part with larger Sums to place them out, but the young Men too uncapable of
doing their Master's better Business, must be content to be employ'd in
Errants, and other mean Service, 'til such Time as they become Proficients.

something himself; not merely to receive, but to produce his knowledge: - as
when the mathematical student proves the proposition which is enunciated by
his teacher, or solves a problem proposed to him; - or when the classical
scholar renders Horace or Thucydides into English.

A large portion of the teaching, in those institutions, has always consisted,
as it still does, of exercises, in which the pupil translates his Greek or
Latin author, proves his proposition, or solves his equation, in the hearing
or under the eye of his tutor; or answers interrogatories, in which he has to
produce the knowledge which he has acquired.

Now it must be observed that, though all branches of science and speculation,
old and new, fixed and moveable, may be made the subjects of exposition in
lectures, practical teaching is applicable only to a limited range of subjects;
- those, namely, in which principles having clear evidence and stable
certainty, form the basis of our knowledge; and in which, consequently, a
distinct possession of the fundamental ideas enables a student to proceed to
their applications, and to acquire the habit of applying them in every case
with ease and rapidity.

vigour and constant effort at real progress and improvement, which has
characterized this quarter of the globe for the last three hundred years.

This idea, too, has now been communicated to persons of education in general,
as the general reception of the Newtonian theory of the universe proves; while,
at the same time, the very indistinct views which men of considerable
cultivation often entertain of the mechanism of the universe, proves that the
fundamental ideas on which a clear apprehension of the doctrine of universal
attraction depends, have hitherto been very imperfectly diffused through the
atmosphere of the literary world.
