water springs, the atmosphere around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of forces in one great mass, 8000 miles in diameter,

the iron weight press upon and flatten the bubble of air - which caused the

a larger one, like that changing one of the balls for a much larger one, there
was much more of this attraction exerted; or, if I made this ball larger and

or, I might take the Earth itself, as the large ball - that then the

In looking over the whole series, from the year of the first discovery of the
satellites in 1787 to the present time, I found these observations so
extensive, especially with regard to a miscellaneous branch of them, that I
resolved to make this latter part the subject of a strict examination.

In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

After having been used to follow up the satellites of Saturn and Jupiter, to
the very margin of their planets, so as even to measure the apparent diameter
of one of Jupiter's satellites by its entrance on the disk, I was in hopes
that a similar opportunity would soon have offered with the Georgian
satellites: not indeed to measure the satellites, but to measure the planet
itself, by means of the passage of the satellite over its disk.

As a belief in want of conformity in the physical constitution of the earth,
in ancient and modern times, was for a long time universally prevalent, and
that too amongst men who were convinced that the order of nature is now
uniform, and has continued so for several thousand years; every circumstance
which could have influenced their minds and given an undue bias to their

that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

If the Italians, for example, in the early part of the twelfth century, had
discovered at Amalphi, instead of the pandects of Justinian, some ancient
manuscripts filled with astronomical observations relating to a period of
three thousand years, and made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical
instruments as perfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on
consulting these memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a
great revolution in the solar and sidereal systems.

caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the
Subapennine hills, now exclusively tropical, to retain no longer any
representatives in the adjoining seas, has also contributed to the
annihilation of certain genera of land-mammifera, which inhabited the

Though the English have not been backward in acknowledging the great merit of
this philosopher, he has had the singular good fortune to be, perhaps, even
more celebrated abroad than at home; so that to form a just idea of the great
and deserved reputation of Dr. Franklin, we must read the foreign publications
on the subject of electricity; in many of which the terms Franklinism,
Franklinist, and the Franklinian system occur in almost every page.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

He says, that when a tube lined with any non-electric is rubbed, what is
collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

second, and what was driven out of the second would be received by the third,

He also says, that when the gilding was varnished even with turpentine, this
varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was
driven through paper, it would be blackened by the smoke, which sometimes
penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the
stroke.

what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our
pleasure are little imitations of those great effects which frighten us, and
that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the
electrized body, and, at a certain proximity from that which is not; I avow

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

In answer to the doubt of Mr. Kinnersley, whether the glass, or the sulphur
electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following
reasons. 1. Because, though the sulphur globe seemed to work equally well with
the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.

the water-oil surface and the air-oil surface; because the two latter acting
