I have no doubt that the patrons of the Queen of Welsh Watering-places, as
they stop here at the little station for the collector to take up their
tickets, sniff mightily at a place that would seem to have nothing to make up
for its painful lack of antiquity, in the way of marine festivity.

Towards Llandudno and the Orme, a couple of miles away, a pleasant sandy shore
divides the sea from wild commons all aglow with gorse and bracken, rolling
here into sand-hills where tufty, bent grass quivers precariously in the wind,
or sinking there into cuppy, sheltered hollows where sheep nibble upon soft
carpets of immemorial turf; while in the north the great mass of the Orme
rises grimly out of the sea from its encircling fringe of foam.

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the

having pass'd the Magellan Streights, in the Year 1615, and sail'd up the
Coast of Chile and Peru, as was there said, cross'd the Equinoctial and, on
the 20th of September, had sight of the Land of New Spain, in the Latitude of
13 Deg. 30 Min. then stood off to Sea, the Weather proving foul, and, October
the 1st, came in Sight of Land again; but the Sea still running high, beat off
