generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

events, so as to conclude that centuries were implied where the characters
imported thousands of years, and thousands of years where the language of
nature signified millions, they could not, if they reasoned logically from
such false premises, come to any other conclusion, than that the system of the
natural world had undergone a complete revolution.

Though the English have not been backward in acknowledging the great merit of
this philosopher, he has had the singular good fortune to be, perhaps, even
more celebrated abroad than at home; so that to form a just idea of the great
and deserved reputation of Dr. Franklin, we must read the foreign publications
on the subject of electricity; in many of which the terms Franklinism,
Franklinist, and the Franklinian system occur in almost every page.

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

As I have drawn it here Fig. 1, it is implied that the tension of the
water-air surface is less than the sum of the other two tensions - those of
the water-oil surface and the air-oil surface; because the two latter acting
obliquely balance the former.
