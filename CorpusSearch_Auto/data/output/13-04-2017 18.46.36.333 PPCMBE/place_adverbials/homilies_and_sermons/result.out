when God's judgments are seen in the earth the inhabitants may learn
righteousness.

For men are, unconsciously, living mere natural lives, without effort, without
aim, without struggle, without victory, without compass, without lode-star,
crossing the perilous sea of this world, where countless souls are shipwrecked,
without any consciousness of peril, or any desire except to escape
unrespectable sins, such as, they hope, that a moderate share of six deadly
sins, pride, covetousness, gluttony, luxury, envy, anger, is not, nor an
entire possession by the seventh, sloth, as far as it is spiritual.

Their noble open-heartedness appeals to many who do not see deeper; who do not
recognize what strong and illuminating moral power is required to open the
heart to such steady and impartial admiration of that which is good, true, and
pure; what ready conscience and controlled attention is needed to 'think on
these things,' as the Apostle would understand thinking; and how far apart is
the admiration which really ennobles and constrains the heart from the languid
sentiment which may only leave us, as it passes, one degree more callous.

But the true meaning and lesson is surely the one of which I spoke before;
that simple goodness and real goodness are of the same stuff; that real
goodness is within reach of any of us because we can all begin upon it where
we are, and find in the very simplest matters opportunities of living and
being like Jesus, the really Good.

when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated
