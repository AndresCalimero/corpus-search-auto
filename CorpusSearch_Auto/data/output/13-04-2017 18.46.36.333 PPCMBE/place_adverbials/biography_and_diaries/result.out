upon as an Addition of new Scandal to her former Dishonour! so that I am

Occupation have starv'd with less Infamy, than had she reliev'd her
Necessities by being famous on the Theatre.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.
