so I told him just as you bad me, that a noble gentleman was come a long
journey from foreign parts to see the lord Lovel, his friend, and having lived
abroad many years, he did not know that he was dead, and that the castle was
fallen into other hands; that upon hearing these tidings he was much grieved
and disappointed, and wanting a night's lodging to rest himself before he
returned to his own home, he was fain to take up with one at our cottage; that
my father thought my lord would be angry with him, if he were not told of the
stranger's journey and intentions, especially to let such a man lye at our
cottage, where he could neither be lodged nor entertained according to his
