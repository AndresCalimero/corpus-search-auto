And, when we come to dig into or examine it as man does for his own
instruction and advantage, in a variety of ways, we see that it is made up of
different kinds of matter, subject to a very few powers; and all disposed in
this strange and wonderful way, which gives to man a history - and such a
history - as to what there is in those veins, in those rocks, the ores, the
water springs, the atmosphere around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of forces in one great mass, 8000 miles in diameter,
that the mind is overwhelmed in contemplation of the wonderful history related
by these strata some of which are fine and thin like sheets of paper, - all
formed in succession by the forces of which I have spoken.

ivory ball, we take a mountain, and put a ball like this near it, we find that,
owing to the vast size of the mountain, as compared with the billiard ball,
the latter is drawn slightly towards it; showing clearly that an attraction
does exist, just as it did between the shell-lac which I rubbed and the piece

- if I raise the gold leaf in this way pulling the bottle up to the ceiling of
the theatre by means of a cord and pulley, and then suddenly letting it fall
to within a few inches of the lecture table, and allow it then to fall from
the ceiling downwards I will put something beneath to catch it, supposing I
should be maladroit, you will perceive that the gold leaf is not in the least
disturbed.

a larger one, like that changing one of the balls for a much larger one, there
was much more of this attraction exerted; or, if I made this ball larger and
larger, until, if it were possible, it became as large as the Earth itself -
or, I might take the Earth itself, as the large ball - that then the
attraction would become so powerful as to cause them to rush together in this

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

consequently, observations should not be given up, till a sufficient time had

As a belief in want of conformity in the physical constitution of the earth,
in ancient and modern times, was for a long time universally prevalent, and

opinions deserves particular attention.

He who has observed the quarrying of stone from a rock, and has seen it
shipped for some distant port, and then endeavours to conceive what kind of
edifice will be raised by the materials, is in the same predicament as a
geologist, who, while he is confined to the land, sees the decomposition of
rocks, and the transportation of matter by rivers to the sea, and then

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

who was never permitted to "sully the fair face of light," and emerge into the

investigating the structure of the globe, he might frame theories the exact

If the Italians, for example, in the early part of the twelfth century, had
discovered at Amalphi, instead of the pandects of Justinian, some ancient
manuscripts filled with astronomical observations relating to a period of
three thousand years, and made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical
instruments as perfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on
consulting these memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a
great revolution in the solar and sidereal systems.

mode of formation of such rocks might be fully elucidated by the study of
processes then going on in certain parts of the Mediterranean, they would have

any one had informed them that, by making experiments on the motion of bodies
on the earth, they might discover the laws which regulated the movements of

In regard to the signs of upraising and sinking, of fracture and contortion in
rocks, it is evident that newer strata $can $not be shaken by earthquakes,
unless the subjacent rocks are also affected; so that the contrast in the
relative degree of disturbance in the more ancient and the newer strata, is
one of many proofs that the convulsions have happened in different eras, and
the fact confirms the uniformity of the action of subterranean forces, instead
of their greater violence in the primeval ages.

But, if we suppose the change to have been extremely slow, and to have
consisted, not so much in a diminution of the mean annual temperature, as in
an alteration from what has been termed an "insular" to an "excessive" climate,
from one in which the temperature of winter and summer were nearly equalized
to one wherein the seasons were violently contrasted, we may, perhaps, explain
the phenomenon.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the

so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,

He also says, that when the gilding was varnished even with turpentine, this
varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was
driven through paper, it would be blackened by the smoke, which sometimes
penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the
stroke.

The Abbe` says, "If any one should take upon him to prove, from a well
connected comparison of phenomena, that thunder is, in the hands of nature,
what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our
pleasure are little imitations of those great effects which frighten us, and
that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the
electrized body, and, at a certain proximity from that which is not; I avow
that this idea, if it was well supported, would give me a great deal of
pleasure;

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

The Doctor, after having published his method of verifying his hypothesis
concerning the sameness of electricity with the matter of lightning, was
waiting for the erection of a spire in Philadelphia to carry his views into
execution; not imagining that a pointed rod, of a moderate height, could
answer the purpose; when it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite,
he could have a readier and better access to the regions of thunder than by
any spire whatever.

In answer to the doubt of Mr. Kinnersley, whether the glass, or the sulphur
electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following
reasons. 1. Because, though the sulphur globe seemed to work equally well with
the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.
