Of the former sort is that which is convey'd to an attentive considerate mind
in the common dispensations of God's Providence; where the notoriety of the
case it self, as it points out the interposition of the finger of God, does
withal suggest the moral duties required of men in such circumstances: so that
when God's judgments are seen in the earth the inhabitants may learn
righteousness.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

This day of publick Humiliation if I may be allowed to apply the words of king
Hezekiah on a like occasion is to us a day of trouble, - of rebuke - and
blasphemy: - Of trouble, - as suggesting uneasy apprehensions of various
unknown dangers and difficulties, incident in the course of a long-continued
and far-extended war: of rebuke to our sanguine hopes, disappointment of our
premature expectations of victories, triumphs, and publick tranquillity: Of
blasphemy, - as affording matter of slander to our enemies from abroad, and of
complaint and murmurs at home.

And with regard to those Patriots who distinguish themselves by a clamorous
zeal for the interests of their country, and on this principle as implicitly
oppose the measures of government, as others support them, let them also ask
their hearts whether their opposition proceeds from true publick spirit and
disinterested views: - or whether they are not influenced by resentment and
hatred of the persons, whom they oppose; by envy of that power or honour,
which they have in vain laboured to acquire; or by love of praise for they

The ambition and intrigues of such perfidious enemies admit no honourable
terms of pacification; who make the very negotiation for peace the means of
prolonging the war; while they artfully delude a proud infatuated nation into
their alliance under their specious pretence of a family-compact - that
formidable confederacy of the House of Bourbon, which may justly give an alarm
to the neighbouring kingdoms, as it hath often embroiled the Powers, and
endangered the Liberties of Europe.

any one Principle is in a particular Man; we could not from thence determine,
how far that Principle would go towards forming the Character, or what
Influence it would have upon the Actions; unless we could likewise discern
what other Principles prevailed in him, and see the Proportion which that one

Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

being a mere Mistake in Language; the real Question, which this is mistaken
for, will, I suppose, be answered by observing, that the Goodness of God
already exercised towards us, our present Dependance upon him, and our
Expectation of future Benefits, ought, and have a natural Tendency, to beget
in us the Affection of Gratitude, and greater Love towards Him, than the same

How many people are there, who, at an early age, leave their friends and their
country, to go into the most unpleasant and unhealthy situations - some into
the most intensely hot countries, and some into the coldest, with the
certainty of not returning till many of the best years of their life are past,
and with the great chance of either dying themselves before the time of their
return arrives, or at any rate of finding many of their dearest friends dead
before they have another opportunity of seeing them.

of an earthly - all this would be just and commendable.

Thus, then, I have endeavoured to point out that the course of things is so
arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another
and higher sphere of existence.

But when we take a more practical view of the subject, and instead of looking
at the abstract character of these blessings, turn our attention to the real
change which they produce in our hearts and conduct; when we think of them not
as they ought to appear to us, but as they do, we are obliged to observe that,
in spite of all we know respecting God and His ways, we are nearly in all
respects the same persons as we should have been without this knowledge, and
that we should probably go on much in the same manner as we do, were our
religious creed no condition in the regulation of our conduct.

It will thus be seen that the advantage which may be derived from the
knowledge of the fact, has a necessary dependance on the habitual religious
condition of the persons to whom it is communicated; and that the process by
which we are to take advantage of it, is a discipline just of the same sort as
that which we undergo in forming virtuous habits; so that to create a strong
impression on the mind, far from being the object of the Dispensation,
scarcely enters into its design: and if in any instance it accidentally
effects this, yet that by so doing it no more fulfils its final purpose, than
the excitement of good impulses completes a virtuous character.

of grace, or that, without grace, these same things would not turn to evil or
be a snare to us, or minister the more fatally to self-deceit, or absorb us
out of the atmosphere of grace, or hide from us God and the invisible; nor
that some of our trials do not lie in them.

of the world, and things despised, yea, things" accounted as if they "were not
" - to confound the wise and the mighty and that which held that it alone was,
in order "that no flesh should glory in His Presence," so He allowed man's
keenest intelligence, and strongest moral power, the instruments which He had
Himself formed in the natural order of things, to try their utmost and fail,
that the Divinity of Jesus and His revelation might stand out the more clearly,
after the recognition of the impotence of what was grand, powerful, beautiful,

Their noble open-heartedness appeals to many who do not see deeper; who do not
recognize what strong and illuminating moral power is required to open the
heart to such steady and impartial admiration of that which is good, true, and
pure; what ready conscience and controlled attention is needed to 'think on
these things,' as the Apostle would understand thinking; and how far apart is
the admiration which really ennobles and constrains the heart from the languid
sentiment which may only leave us, as it passes, one degree more callous.

Though far inferior to the Apostle in gifts, or knowledge of what may be the
designs of the Almighty; yet, as a veteran in your service, who feels daily
the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

I mean, the being of a God; his creation of the whole world; and his
providential care of it, and of every individual in it: the Revelations he has
made of himself and of his will to mankind; to Adam, to the Patriarchs, to the
Israelites or Jews by Moses, and last of all by Jesus Christ his Son; whom he
sent in the nature and form of mortal man, to redeem mankind from sin and from
death; to proclaim pardon to us all, on repentance and amendment of life; to
assure us, through faith in him, of a resurrection to eternal life; and to
eternal happiness in that life, provided we exert our endeavors to live in
obedience to his commands during our continuance here; and with a promise,
that we shall receive the assistance of God's holy Spirit, if we seek and ask
it, to help our infirmities, and enable us to do what He expects us to strive
to perform.

Indeed against them, it is proper from time to time to caution mankind:
because that is a corruption of Christianity expressly pointed out by Prophecy,
as what was to arise in the Church of Christ, and what is to continue for a
certain specific term and no longer: a corrupt Church, from whose Communion
God's "people" are exhorted to "come out" before its destruction; for that it
should come to an end and be destroyed with a signal destruction before the
coming of Christ to judgement.

Though distressing it was to think, that the human mind should so far debase
itself, and depart from all sense of right, as in these enlightened days to
question the existence of a Deity, whose wonderful works are better known than
ever they were in former times; little was it to be expected that we should
live to see the day, when Atheism is publicly professed in an assembly of one
of the most enlightened nations, and received there with applause.

Though our endeavors have been to obviate the mischievous spreading of the

foundation of Revelation; little could it be imagined that the day would come,
when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated
there with next to divine honours.

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

themselves worthy, during their continuance here, to be elect of God, and be
made partakers of the first resurrection in Christ's kingdom. After which, at
the final consummation, all shall be raised; and all shall be judged by Christ
himself; and all shall be sentenced to happiness or to misery, according to
what they have done in the body, whether it be good or evil; when Christ,
having accomplished all things, shall "give up the Kingdom to God the Father,

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

polite arts; insensed at such inquiry by one so far his inferior in rank,

But, as I told you in one of those discourses, so it may be proper to repeat
that now, The great distinction between the Church of Rome and those who
protested, was at that time, and continues to this day, and ought for ever to
be kept in remembrance by those who call themselves Protestants; that the
Papist or Roman Catholic, derives the rule of Faith and Practice from the
Decrees of his Church; the Protestant, from the word of God alone.
