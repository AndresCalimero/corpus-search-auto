But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Towards Llandudno and the Orme, a couple of miles away, a pleasant sandy shore
divides the sea from wild commons all aglow with gorse and bracken, rolling
here into sand-hills where tufty, bent grass quivers precariously in the wind,
or sinking there into cuppy, sheltered hollows where sheep nibble upon soft
carpets of immemorial turf; while in the north the great mass of the Orme
rises grimly out of the sea from its encircling fringe of foam.

background as the panelled walls of Pla`s Mawr, and to pass in and out of your

the Mayors of Conway are, of King Edward's stately pile, and do its honours to

Ferdinand Cortes prepar'd to advance to that City, Embassadors came to him,
from the neighbouring Province of Zempoala, to settle a strict Amity with him,
and declaring themselves mortal Enemies to the Mexicans, for their
Incroachments and Cruelty; which was very acceptable to Cortes, who, by this

his own Subjects, as well as Neighbours.

immediate dependance upon the Chinese, I could plainly trace the greatest awe

Rimbochay, who had usurped even, from the hands of Dalai Lama, the greatest
portion of his temporal power.
