But as it is possible that Envy, Prejudice, or Party, may sometimes have a
share in what is generally thrown upon 'em, it is not easy for a private Man,
to know who is absolutely in the right, from what is said against them, or
from what their Friends or Dependants may say in their Favour: Tho' I can
hardly forbear thinking that they who have been longest rail'd at, must, from
that Circumstance shew, in some sort a Proof of Capacity.

When we consider, in what height of the Nation's Prosperity, the Successor of
Queen Elizabeth came to this Throne, it seems amazing, that such a Pile of
English Fame and Glory, which her skilful Administration had erected, should,
in every following Reign, down to the Revolution, so unhappily moulder away,
in one continual Gradation of Political Errors: All which must have been
avoided, if the plain Rule, which that wise Princess left behind her, had been
observed, viz. That the Love of her People was the surest Support of her
Throne.

We had not been many Days at Nottingham before we heard, that the Prince of
Denmark, with some other great Persons, were gone off, from the King, to the
Prince of Orange, and that the Princess Anne, fearing the King her $Father $'s
Resentment might fall upon her, for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her
self, in the Night, from London, and was then within half a Days Journey of
Nottingham; on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News, that
two thousand of the King's Dragoons were in close pursuit to bring her back

thus: That she has liv'd to all Appearance a peculiar Favourite of Providence;
that few Examples can parallel the Profusion of Blessings which have attended
so long a Life of Felicity. A Person so attractive! a Husband so memorably

That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within

To these laudable Distinctions let me add one more; that of Publick Applause,
which, when truly merited, is perhaps, one of the most agreeable
Gratifications that venial Vanity can feel. A Happiness almost peculiar to the
Actor, insomuch that the best Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate
Admirers may be, yet, to unite them into one general Act of Praise, to receive
at once, those thundring Peals of Approbation, which a crouded Theatre throws
out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor, to raise and
partake of them.

Her Second Son, the worthy Person of whom I am now to give a more particular
Account, was born at Carriden, in Linlithgow-Shire, on the 10th of January,
A.D. 1687-8, the memorable Year of that glorious Revolution which he justly
esteem'd among the happiest of all Events. So that, when he was slain in the
Defence of those Liberties, which God then by so gracious a Providence rescued
from utter Destruction, i.e. on the 21st of September 1745, he was aged 57
Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days.

some of his gay Friends, on hearing the Story, rallied him upon the Efficacy
of his Prayers, he excused himself from the scandal of being thought much in

Aunt were asleep; or else he should have left that Part of the Business to
them." A Speech, which I should not have mentioned, but as it shews in so

he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,

"Yea, I have known those of distinguished Genius, polite Manners, and great
Experience in Human Affairs, who, after having outgrown all the Impressions of
a Religious Education; after having been hardned, rather than subdued, by the
most singular Mercies, even various, repeated, and astonishing Deliverances,
which have appeared to themselves as no less than miraculous; after having
lived for Years without God in the world, notoriously corrupt themselves, and
labouring to the utmost to corrupt others, have been stopt on a sudden in the
full Career of their Sin, and have felt such Rays of the Divine Presence, and
of Redeeming Love, darting in upon their Minds, almost like Lightning from
Heaven, as have at once rouzed, over-powered, and transformed them: So that
they have come out of their Secret Chambers with an irreconcilable Enmity to
those Vices, to which, when they entered them, they were the tamest and most
abandoned Slaves; and have appeared from that very Hour the Votaries, the
Patrons, the Champions of Religion;

And indeed, when I consider how habitual all those criminal Indulgences were
grown to him, and that he was now in the Prime of Life, and all this while in
high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very
Constitution, that he was used strangely to think, and to say, that
Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and

to those who have been used to a sick room, when it says in the morning he
asked the hour, they told him six, he answered, all went on regularly, he felt
he had but a few hours to live, every thing rushed into mind, all the
accompaniments, the expiring rush light, as day begins to break, the
attendants stalking about gently after sitting up all night, whispering to
each other and now & then drawing back the window curtain to see how near the
day, the Stars twinkling like gems, as if they were doing their utmost before
they are extinguished by the Sun - and Johnson with proven energy in his
expiring awful voice begging mercy at intervals of the Almighty.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

yellow, back yellow with green chequers, head green with a yellow ring round
its neck, and two black triangular spots on the ring with their points
directed down the back.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

all ships should pass this way, in order that all might pay their shares: none
from that time using the passage of the Belt; because it was not fitting that

We decided to drop Greek entirely in the three lowest classes, with a view of
getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.

"Most gracious Sovereign, So inconsiderable as we are, a people scattered and
peeled, and trodden under Foot from the Beginning hitherto, we should in no
wise have presumed, even on this Great Occasion, to open our Lips to your
Majesty, had we not been induced, indeed constrained so to do, by two
considerations: The One, that in spite of all our Remonstrances on that head,
we are continually represented, as a peculiar Sect of Men, separating
ourselves from the established Church: The Other, that we are still traduced
as inclined to Popery, and consequently disaffected to your Majesty.
