Did not the Actions of almost every succeeding Reign shew, there were still so
many Doors of Oppression left open to the Prerogative, that whatever Value our
most eloquent Legislators may have set upon those ancient Liberties I doubt it
will be difficult to fix the Period of their having a real Being, before the
Revolution: Or if there ever was an elder Period of our unmolested enjoying
them, I own, my poor Judgment is at a loss where to place it.

Resentment might fall upon her, for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her
self, in the Night, from London, and was then within half a Days Journey of
Nottingham; on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News, that

which perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests, and both

And which I think deserves particular Remark though he assuredly believed that
he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,
and to that Blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a Manner set forth

high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very
Constitution, that he was used strangely to think, and to say, that
Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and

I should have at once considered the waters of the Lac de Chede to be
cupriferous, had it not been for their excessive clearness, and for the
presence of numerous water serpents, one of which we caught as it was twisting
about among the grass and reeds near the shore, holding its head well above
water. About 14 inches long I believe there are some nearly a yard, belly
yellow, back yellow with green chequers, head green with a yellow ring round
its neck, and two black triangular spots on the ring with their points
directed down the back.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

Bradley's paper was very good, excepting from the one fatal defect to me its
chief merit, that he did not realise the least the deadly character of his own
admissions against hostels, and proceeds at the end to suggest improvements.
As if the only true thing was not fairly to admit their great evils, and then
if it $can $not be helped, to have them with eyes opened as being the best
that can be got, instead of whitewashing the sepulchre.
