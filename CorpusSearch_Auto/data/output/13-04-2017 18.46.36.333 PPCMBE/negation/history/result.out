they then were, they should not only save those Places, but sufficiently
defend the Isthmus, which the Barbarians should not so much as once look upon,
if the Grecians got the Victory at Sea.

Nevertheless, even after this, the highest Protestations of Friendship pass'd
between the two Courts, Charles being afraid of the Queen of $England $'s
assisting the Huguenots, and she being willing to gain Time, that she might
penetrate farther into the Designs of her Enemies; so that the Huguenots could
not tell what to make of their good Protectress, who had even gone so far as
to stand Godmother to Charles's new-born Daughter, after the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; which might make one believe, that her Zeal for the Protestant
Religion was always subordinate to her private Interest. Tho' this must be
observ'd, that she ordered her Ambassador, who was to represent her, not to be
present at the Mass in the Ceremony of the Christening; and if it should be
insisted on, to get the Queen of Navarre to stand in his Room.
