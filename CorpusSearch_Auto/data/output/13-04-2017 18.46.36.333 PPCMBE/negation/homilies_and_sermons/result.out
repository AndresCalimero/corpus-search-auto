Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

And though this way of thinking were just with respect to the imperfect State
we are now in, where we know so little of Satisfaction without Satiety; yet it
must be guarded against, when we are considering the Happiness of a State of
Perfection; which Happiness being Enjoyment and not Hope, must necessarily
consist in this, that our Affections have their Objects, and rest in those
Objects as an End, i. e. be satisfied with them.

Thus, then, I have endeavoured to point out that the course of things is so
arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another
and higher sphere of existence.

But when we take a more practical view of the subject, and instead of looking
at the abstract character of these blessings, turn our attention to the real
change which they produce in our hearts and conduct; when we think of them not
as they ought to appear to us, but as they do, we are obliged to observe that,
in spite of all we know respecting God and His ways, we are nearly in all
respects the same persons as we should have been without this knowledge, and
that we should probably go on much in the same manner as we do, were our
religious creed no condition in the regulation of our conduct.

Now it has advantages for our soul's good, that we do live in a refined,
reading, intellectual, active age. Not, as I said, that nature can do the work
of grace, or that, without grace, these same things would not turn to evil or
be a snare to us, or minister the more fatally to self-deceit, or absorb us
out of the atmosphere of grace, or hide from us God and the invisible; nor
that some of our trials do not lie in them.

"We," says S. Paul, "with face which hath been unveiled," - mind, he says not,
with face which sees by any natural discernment of its own, but with face from
which the veil, which intercepted the light of Divine truth, has been removed
by another, that is by Christ and the Spirit of Christ, - "We, with face
unveiled" by Christ in our conversion to God, "beholding in a mirror," no
longer any reflection of our natural selves, but "the glory of God," are
illumined by that Divine light which we behold;

Their noble open-heartedness appeals to many who do not see deeper; who do not
recognize what strong and illuminating moral power is required to open the
heart to such steady and impartial admiration of that which is good, true, and
pure; what ready conscience and controlled attention is needed to 'think on
these things,' as the Apostle would understand thinking; and how far apart is
the admiration which really ennobles and constrains the heart from the languid
sentiment which may only leave us, as it passes, one degree more callous.

Though far inferior to the Apostle in gifts, or knowledge of what may be the
designs of the Almighty; yet, as a veteran in your service, who feels daily
the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

But their supposing that Faith alone is to save men, without a suitable
Practice in the conduct of their lives, is as certainly an Error: which will
lead, and we see does lead some into the habitual practice of vice; from a
supposition that on account of their profession of Faith, they are secure of
happiness eternal, however they may behave; and which does lead others of
better disposition, into melancholy and despair, and thence too frequently
into absolute madness; from their not having presumption enough to pretend to
feel what they do not feel; or enthusiasm enough to fancy they feel an

when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated

yet it is for us to say, that the people, if they consult their own happiness,
will not be hasty to desire a change; that temperate and gradual amendments
are all that can be desirable; that on any great change, the interval of
Anarchy is always far worse for the people, than the very worst of governments;
and that the common people, who generally mean well, always find themselves at
last the dupes of aspiring leaders of faction.

Minister of God to you "beseech you Brethren, by your hope in God; by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ," which I know you all expect; "and by our
gathering together unto him," which is to be in its due time; "that ye be not
shaken in mind," as though there could be any doubt of Christ's having come to
redeem the world; or of his being to come again to judge mankind;

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.
