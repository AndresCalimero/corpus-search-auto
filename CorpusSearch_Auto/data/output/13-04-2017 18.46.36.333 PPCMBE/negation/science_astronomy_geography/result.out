If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

elapsed to obtain a better view of such a supposed ring, by a removal of the

In regard to the signs of upraising and sinking, of fracture and contortion in
rocks, it is evident that newer strata $can $not be shaken by earthquakes,
unless the subjacent rocks are also affected; so that the contrast in the
relative degree of disturbance in the more ancient and the newer strata, is
one of many proofs that the convulsions have happened in different eras, and
the fact confirms the uniformity of the action of subterranean forces, instead
of their greater violence in the primeval ages.

But, if we suppose the change to have been extremely slow, and to have
consisted, not so much in a diminution of the mean annual temperature, as in
an alteration from what has been termed an "insular" to an "excessive" climate,
from one in which the temperature of winter and summer were nearly equalized
to one wherein the seasons were violently contrasted, we may, perhaps, explain
the phenomenon.

that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the

The Doctor, after having published his method of verifying his hypothesis
concerning the sameness of electricity with the matter of lightning, was
waiting for the erection of a spire in Philadelphia to carry his views into
execution; not imagining that a pointed rod, of a moderate height, could
answer the purpose; when it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite,
he could have a readier and better access to the regions of thunder than by
any spire whatever.
