It is evident by Experience, that there are several Arts and Sciences, which
$can $not be learn'd in any great Perfection, without the Knowledge of Latin,
or Greek, or other Antient Languages. Upon which Account it must be confess'd,
that those Persons. who design to Study such Arts or Sciences, ought to be
very well acquainted with these Languages; seeing an imperfect Knowledge of
them, only serves for Ostentation amongst the Ignorant, but is of no great
real use or Advantage.

if it is not a sufficient reason, it will be necessary to fall back on the

I appeal to common Sense, if the having a Grammar of our Mother-Tongue first
taught in our Schools would not so far facilitate our Youths learning their
Latin and Greek Grammars, as to afford 'em spare-time for Arithmetic,
Astronomy, Geography, History, and other useful Knowledges, that would make
them pass the Spring of their Life with Pleasure and Profit, that is now
miserably worn out in Grammatical Perplexities.

Instead of teaching them patiently to endure pain and disappointment, and the
other evils of life, which $can $not be altogether avoided; instead of
teaching them to govern their passions, and direct them to proper objects,
their parents are often blind enough to allow them to contract an impatience
under misfortune, and an impetuosity of spirit when thwarted, which, gathering
strength from indulgence, are often productive of trouble to others, and of
misery to themselves.

by being inserted into plum stocks; peaches by being put into apricot; as also
cherries, such as the Flanders kind, hart, duke, &c. put into wild or black
cherry stocks, by which means in two or three years they become fruit-bearing
trees, which if raised from the stones, or propagated from suckers, would not

Dr. Reynolds, after pointing out that for the production of a complicated
movement, such as writing, the integrity of a great number of parts is
necessary - the will, motor and sensory nerve-fibres, certain ganglia situate
upon the nerve-trunks, the cerebellum, the muscles, and the special senses -
goes on to say that in the disease in question 'it $can $not be doubted that
some changes take place in the nutrition of the parts through which the lines
of nerve action, regulating the secondarily automatic movements, run.

until it has attained a large size; the Japanese Horse-chestnut Aesculus
turbinata; the elegant Styrax japonicum; Betula Maximowiczi, a handsome Beech
remarkable for its large leaves and yellow bark; Quercus acuta, Q. glabra

With a fuller knowledge of the distinctive characteristics of the many
beautiful trees, shrubs, &c., that had been introduced from Japan, and the
increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the various phases of garden
design that had long found favour in that country, it is not surprising that a
strong desire should have been felt by many owners of gardens within the
British Isles to create gardens more or less in accordance with Japanese ideas.

One of the principal rules governing the work of the landscape gardener in
Japan is to follow nature as far as is practicable, and to arrange the
arborescent and other forms of plant life in their natural associations. That
is to say, plants which in a state of nature have their home on the mountain
side are not to be brought down to those parts of the garden which represent
the lowlands, and, it may be, used in the formation of a flowery fringe to
running stream or silent pool.

earnestly recommend the Study of the French Tongue, which will both be much
easier attain'd, and prove much more serviceable in Business, as being now
almost the common Speech of Europe; and, consequently, not only qualifying a
Man to travel Abroad, and by that Means to improve his Trafick beyond the Seas,
but also of frequent Use in their Shops at Home, to their great Advantage in

In another mode of teaching, the learner has not merely to listen, but to do
something himself; not merely to receive, but to produce his knowledge: - as
when the mathematical student proves the proposition which is enunciated by
his teacher, or solves a problem proposed to him; - or when the classical
scholar renders Horace or Thucydides into English.
