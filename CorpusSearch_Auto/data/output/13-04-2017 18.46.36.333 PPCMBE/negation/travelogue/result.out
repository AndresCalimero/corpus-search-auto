But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

out to sea, "preserving its stream inviolate" - "I must not pass over in
silence the mountains called Eryri by the Welsh, and by the English Snowdon,
or mountains of snow, which gradually increasing from the land of the Sons of
Conan, and extending themselves northward even to Deganwy, seem to rear their

of the Coast of New Spain, 'till the 5th of June 1578, when being in the
Latitude of 43 Degrees, and finding it very cold, he stood in for the Land,
which they tell us was not mountainous, and fell into a good Bay, in 38

Bearings of all the Coasts on the Back of America, from the Island of

Harbours, taken from the Spanish Coasting-Pilots, and other curious Cuts,
which, with several Curiosities, too tedious to be here taken Notice of, will
