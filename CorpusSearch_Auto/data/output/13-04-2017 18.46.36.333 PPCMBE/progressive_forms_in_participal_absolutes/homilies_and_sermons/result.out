But after all, if the terms in that day be understood as connected with the
clause immediately preceding, then the time of the Prophecy probably takes
place, when the Assyrian powers being for a while withdrawn, the Jews had
improved the advantage of that calm interval, and having compleated the
fortifications of Jerusalem, now triumphed in their imaginary state of
security:

Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

But the Question, whether we ought to love God for his Sake or for our own,
being a mere Mistake in Language; the real Question, which this is mistaken
for, will, I suppose, be answered by observing, that the Goodness of God
already exercised towards us, our present Dependance upon him, and our
Expectation of future Benefits, ought, and have a natural Tendency, to beget
in us the Affection of Gratitude, and greater Love towards Him, than the same
Goodness exercised towards others; were it only for this Reason, that every
Affection is moved in Proportion to the Sense we have of the Object of it;

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.
