that Mohun, and Hart now growing old for, above thirty Years before this Time,

impatient to get into their Parts, and growing intractable, the Audiences too

which perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests, and both

streets of Dublin unremarked, in the old dress, worn in the days of Charles
the Second; a large cocked hat, all on one side his face, nearly covering his
left eye; a great powdered wig, hanging at the side in curls, and in the
centre at the back a large black cockade, with a small drop curl from it; his
embroidered waistcoat down to his knees; the top of his coat not within three
inches of his neck, the hip buttons about a foot from it; buttons all the way
down the coat, but only one at the waist buttoned; the hilt of the sword
through the opening of the skirt; a long cravat, fringed, the end pulled
through the third button-hole; small buckles; the coat sleeves very short, and
the shirt sleeves pulled down, but hid by the top of the gloves, and the
ruffles hanging out at the opening of the cuff; the waistcoat entirely open
except the lower button, displaying the finely plaited frill.

backs into the deep, blue, silent heaven, gathering themselves around you on

cloud, white misty wreaths billowing beneath you, and whirling past you, and

the consent of the traders to that sea, Denmark taking upon itself the charge
of constructing lighthouses, and erecting signals, to mark the shoals and
rocks from the Cattegat to the Baltic: and they, on their part, agreeing that
all ships should pass this way, in order that all might pay their shares: none
from that time using the passage of the Belt; because it was not fitting that
they, who enjoyed the benefit of the beacons in dark and stormy weather,
should evade contributing to them in fair seasons and summer nights.
