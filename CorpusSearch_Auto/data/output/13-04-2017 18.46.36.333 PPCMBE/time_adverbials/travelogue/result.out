But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the
very Welsh.

This is, I think, the very worst that can be said of Welshmen, that is to say
of the class who more particularly claim for themselves the title of "good

their part.

as great a popularity amongst all ranks of people where they presided, as this
venerable Hollander at the settlement of the Cape, there had been no occasion
for British swords to have been drawn, or British bayonets to have been
pointed at the breasts of fellow subjects and countrymen, who in the last most
glorious war bled at each other's side, brave and victorious warriors, in the
common cause of Great Britain and their Sovereign.

friendship established between himself and you, might suffer interruption, and
undergo a change.
