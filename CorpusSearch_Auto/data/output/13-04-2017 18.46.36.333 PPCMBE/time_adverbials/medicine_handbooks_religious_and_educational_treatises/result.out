learn'd to decline Nouns and Verbs, taught no other Book for some Time, but
the New Testament, because, for the Reasons already alledg'd, I look upon it

rheumatism, such painful affections of the muscular fibres, membranes, and
joints as are unattended with fever, specific virus, or peculiar derangement
of the stomach and bowels; and which are seldom accompanied with external
tumor or inflammation, but are very liable to shift suddenly from one part to
another, and are readily propagated along the course of the membranes and

I appeal to common Sense, if the having a Grammar of our Mother-Tongue first
taught in our Schools would not so far facilitate our Youths learning their
Latin and Greek Grammars, as to afford 'em spare-time for Arithmetic,
Astronomy, Geography, History, and other useful Knowledges, that would make
them pass the Spring of their Life with Pleasure and Profit, that is now

Instead of teaching them patiently to endure pain and disappointment, and the
other evils of life, which $can $not be altogether avoided; instead of
teaching them to govern their passions, and direct them to proper objects,
their parents are often blind enough to allow them to contract an impatience
under misfortune, and an impetuosity of spirit when thwarted, which, gathering
strength from indulgence, are often productive of trouble to others, and of
misery to themselves.

but, I beg the Doctor 's Leave to tell my Readers, That a curious and
ingenuous Bee-Master informs me, that, for a Trial of this, he has begun early
in the Month of June to kill the Drones of an Hive, and has continued so to do,
from Day to Day, until he could find no more to kill; and that he was very
positive, that few, if any, escaped his Knife, and that yet, that Hive was as
forward and Thriving next Spring as any other, whence it may be concluded,
that another Father, than the Drones, must be found out, for the next Year's
Brood.

68. Now, I think, I have directed you how to bring your Hive safe to the Month
of April, the Time, when Bees commonly set out in our Country to their Work,
and when they begin to increase their Family; for which End they lay their
Eggs in Cells, and go abroad to fetch in that Stuff commonly called Bee-Bread,
concerning which, its Preparation and Use in feeding young Bees, from their
first Formation, until they are able to provide for themselves, you shall be
informed before this Treatise is ended, in the Answers to Questions relative
to these Matters.

in order, then to guard the inexperienced against impositions of this sort, it
will be necessary to apprise such, that a colt is foaled without teeth; in a
few days, he puts out four, which are called pincers, or nippers; soon after,
appear the four separators, next to the nippers; it is sometimes three or four
months before the next, called the corner teeth, push forth; these twelve
colt's teeth, in the front of the mouth, continue without alternation, till
the colt is two years and a half old, which makes it difficult, without great
care, to avoid being imposed upon during that interval, if the seller finds it
his interest to make the colt pass for either younger or older than he really
is; the only rule you then have to judge by is his coat, and the hairs of his
mane and tail.

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

The prevailing Method of Education at present, is, as soon as a Child can
stammer over a Chapter in the Bible, and before he has well lost the uncouth
Tone of Pronunciation, which he has perhaps learnt of his Mistress, he is
immediately sent to the Latin School; where, instead of studying his own
Language, and improving in the necessary Qualifications of reading it
distinctly, and with proper Emphasis, he is unreasonably enter'd upon a Latin
Grammar, and bewilder'd in unintelligible Jargon.

But, as some Persons may be engag'd in Business, wherein is very little Use of
this Science, by which Means they may be liable to forget what they had
learn'd; and others may be so hastily enter'd upon what may very much require
it, as not to have Time to obtain a sufficient Knowledge therein, I sometime
ago publish'd a little Treatise, in a neat Pocket Volume, under the Title of
Arithmetick in Epitome, or, a Compendium of all its Rules, both Vulgar and
Decimal. Which Book, as it was chiefly intended, and, at first, particularly
dedicated to the ingenious Clerks and Accomptants of the several Offices of
Great Britain, so it has so far had the good Fortune to please, as to have
already past two Impressions.

Is it not strange then, that an Accomplishment so advantagious and necessary,
should be so much slighted and neglected, as that perhaps of fifty British
Youths put out to Business absolutely requiring it, scarce one shall be found
therein fitly qualify'd? Upon which Account the Parents are not only oblig'd
to part with larger Sums to place them out, but the young Men too uncapable of
doing their Master's better Business, must be content to be employ'd in
Errants, and other mean Service, 'til such Time as they become Proficients.

as the general reception of the Newtonian theory of the universe proves; while,

fundamental ideas on which a clear apprehension of the doctrine of universal
