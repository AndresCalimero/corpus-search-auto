the Streights of Ossa and Olympus, might hinder the Passage of the Persians.

In the mean time, the Persian Fleet arriv'd at Aphetae, where discovering the
Smallness of the Grecian Fleet, which lay at Artemisium, the Persian Admirals
resolv'd to engage them; wherefore imagining, that the Grecians would
immediately fly at the first Motion of their Fleet, they sent 200 Sail,
ordering them to leave the Island Sciathus on their right, and launch into the
open Sea, lest, if they cruis'd too near Euboea, they should be seen by the
Enemy: And as soon as they pass'd Geraestus and Caphareus, lying upon the
extreme parts of Euboea, near the Mouth of the Straits, to sail up the River
Euripus, and fall upon the Grecians behind, while the rest of the Fleet, which
lay at Aphetae, attack'd them before, by which means they hop'd to destroy the
whole Grecian Fleet.

Nevertheless, even after this, the highest Protestations of Friendship pass'd
between the two Courts, Charles being afraid of the Queen of $England $'s
assisting the Huguenots, and she being willing to gain Time, that she might
penetrate farther into the Designs of her Enemies; so that the Huguenots could
not tell what to make of their good Protectress, who had even gone so far as
to stand Godmother to Charles's new-born Daughter, after the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; which might make one believe, that her Zeal for the Protestant
Religion was always subordinate to her private Interest. Tho' this must be
observ'd, that she ordered her Ambassador, who was to represent her, not to be
present at the Mass in the Ceremony of the Christening; and if it should be
insisted on, to get the Queen of Navarre to stand in his Room.
