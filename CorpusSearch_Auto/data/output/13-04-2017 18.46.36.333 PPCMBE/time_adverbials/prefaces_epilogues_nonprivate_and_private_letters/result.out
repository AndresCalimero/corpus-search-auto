Sir, We humbly conceive it is our Duty to represent to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that in the Action between his Majesty's Squadron, and that
of Spain, which happened on the first of Octob. 1748, near the Havanna, that
by Rear-Admiral Knowles's bad Conduct, mistaken Signals, and $Un-Officerlike
Attack, he gave great Advantage to the Enemy; by engaging in a straggling Line
a superior Squadron drawn up in a close Line of Battle, late in the Day, when
he might have attacked them much earlier, and to greater Advantage. That his
Majesty's Ship Cornwal was not in the Action an Hour. That to the great
Dishonour of the British Flag, Rear-Admiral Knowles, not only unnecessarily
carried, but kept his Majesty's Flag out of Action. That he has endeavoured to
deceive his Majesty, their Lordships, and the Publick, by having transmitted a
false and injurious Account of the said Action, to Mr. Corbet, by Letter of
the 2d of October 1748; all which we are ready to prove,

I have sometimes thought that the real test of a schoolmaster or mistress
would be whether the children go on after they have left school liking to
inform themselves, liking to observe, liking to read up a thing: or whether
they forget all they have been taught, never to open a book, and even forget
how to read or write correctly. worse still, forget religion & morality.

As you ask me, I venture to think that the one thing to call Nurses' attention
to 'now' is 1. the need of what no Cert'e can certify, no Exam'n can touch and
2. the necessity of attaching herself to some Home with motherly & trained
supervision, so that she may have some 'esprit de corps' to guide & support
her.

The modern tendencies seem to be to let out Nurses like Plumbers - for so many
hours a day to the Wards - Sisters or Head Nurses included - & then to let
them live for the remaining hours quite apart from the Hospital - wanting the
motherly element altogether - essential to a Nurse who is not a Plumber - but
has the care of soul & body in her Patients, & in her Assistant Nurses to
certify them as Plumbers. 2 to substitute the literary Nurse for the practical
Nurse who is to be raised by the moral side quite as much as by the technical
side - to have a spirit put into her quite as much as a hand.

fall into the hands of the Allies to officers to be appointed by the King of

should be put in communication with these officers to be appointed by the King
of France, and should make upon them the requisitions for the several supplies
they should require for their armies respectively; that the King of $France
$'s officers should enforce these requisitions upon the country, taking care
to give to the owners proper receipts and vouchers for the property taken from
them; and that these receipts and vouchers should be taken up, and should be a
