intermitting fevers, when the bark and other remedies have failed, as I have

the help of physicians.

If I add a little liquid to the marble and decompose it, I get that which you
see - the Lecturer here put several lumps of marble into a glass jar, and
poured water and then acid over them; the carbonic acid immediately commenced
to escape with considerable effervescence - the appearance of boiling, which
is only the separation of one part of the marble from another.

When the $unlooked_for association of such rare phenomena is witnessed in the
present course of nature, it scarcely ever fails to excite a suspicion of the
preternatural in those minds which are not firmly convinced of the uniform

they are interested, happens to be accompanied by the appearance of a luminous
meteor, or a comet, or the shock of an earthquake.

mode of formation of such rocks might be fully elucidated by the study of
processes then going on in certain parts of the Mediterranean, they would have

any one had informed them that, by making experiments on the motion of bodies
on the earth, they might discover the laws which regulated the movements of

epoch parsimonious of time and prodigal of violence - to imagine that one

and desolation over the whole earth, or even over one great region.

caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the

annihilation of certain genera of land-mammifera, which inhabited the

what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our
pleasure are little imitations of those great effects which frighten us, and
that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the
electrized body, and, at a certain proximity from that which is not; I avow

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

But the grand practical use which Dr. Franklin made of his discovery of the
sameness of electricity and lightning, was to secure buildings from being
damaged by lightning, a thing of vast consequence in all parts of the world,
but more especially in several parts of North America, where thunder storms
are more frequent, and their effects, in that dry air, more dreadful, than
they are ever known to be with us.

In answer to the doubt of Mr. Kinnersley, whether the glass, or the sulphur
electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following
reasons. 1. Because, though the sulphur globe seemed to work equally well with
the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.

But the decomposition takes place in a very peculiar manner, and under such
conditions that there is a gradual transition from the soapy liquid in the
interior to the oily layer at the top, and not, as when we float a layer of
oil on water, two sudden transitions, first from water to oil, and secondly
from oil to air.
