thereof, in regard the Duties of one Boiling of Sope so hid and concealed, may
and often do amount to fifty Pounds or more, whereby some ill-disposed Persons
have been encouraged and induced to hide and conceal several great Quantities
of Sope, to the great Diminution of the Revenues arising by the Duties laid

thirty-ninth and fortieth years of his present Majesty, and of thirty thousand
pounds, granted by an act of the last session of parliament, or of so much
thereof as shall be found necessary to issue for the services aforesaid, it

Majesty's treasury for the time being, that the duties hereby granted are more
than sufficient to defray the charges and expences already incurred, and also
such further expences as may be necessary for carrying the several purposes of
this act into execution, it shall and may be lawful for the said lord
high-treasurer, or lords-commissioners for the time being, from time to time,
by any warrant or warrants under the hands of the said lord high-treasurer, or
of the said lords-commissioners for the time being, or of any three or more of
the said lords-commissioners, to order and direct, that the duties hereby

proper, and also by like warrant or warrants in case the said necessary
expences should afterwards require an increase of the said duties to order and
direct that the same shall be again raised and increased to any amount not
exceeding the sums which have been before granted by parliament as aforesaid;
and such warrant or warrants shall be sufficient authority to the
commissioners and officers of the customs, for raising, levying, collecting,

change, and alter; as also our said Lord the King, to Death, and final

Sir Richard Lloyd. Call Samuel Maddox, who appeared and was sworn, and said,
the first Time he saw the Prisoner Colonel Townley was at Manchester, about
the 6th, 7th, or 8th Day of December last, but the Day he could not
particularly remember and said the Prisoner was made Colonel of the Manchester
Regiment by the Pretender's Son; and one Reason why he was certain he was
Colonel of the Regiment, was, that a Guard from the said Regiment was mounted
every Day, and Centinels placed at the Prisoner's Quarters; that he the said
Maddox marched out with him in the Station of an Ensign, but never had any
Commission, tho' he carried the Colours as such; that the Prisoner wore a
Sword and a Brace of Pistols, with a white Cockade in his Hat, and that the
Prisoner gave Command as Colonel of the Regiment, and that he ordered the said
Manchester Regiment to be drawn up in the Church Yard, in Manchester, where
the Pretender's Son reviewed them, and that he marched at the Head of the
Regiment as Colonel to Derby.

This Witness farther depos'd, that when they were at Derby with the Rebel Army,
they beat up for Volunteers for the Manchester Regiment, commanded by the
Honourable Colonel Francis Townley, and that the same was done by the
particular Order and Direction of the Prisoner. That when the Rebel Army
retreated from Derby, Col. Townley the Prisoner, and some of his Regiment,
took out of a House between Derby and Ashborn, a Sack full of Arms, which were
concealed under some old Writings; that the said Arms were taken with them to
Ashborn, and lodg'd all Night in the Prisoner's own Room, and dispos'd of
afterwards among his Men; that the Prisoner had two Centinels always at his
Door all Night for fear the Duke of Cumberland was nearer to them then they
imagined; that the Prisoner march'd as Col. of the Manchester Regiment, in
their Retreat from Derby to Carlisle some Times at the Head of the Regiment;
that when they came to Carlisle, the Prisoner was made by the Pretender's Son
Commandant of Carlisle; and had another Commission given him by the
Pretender's Son to raise a Regiment of Horse; that so soon as the main Body of
the Rebel Army were gone from Carlisle for Scotland, he the Prisoner took on
him the Command of the whole Rebel Forces left there, and that he gave Orders
for the Guns to be mounted, and also ordered a House to be burnt; which was
accordingly done, alledging that several of the King's Forces had fired from
it, and annoyed the Pretender's Army; and that he particularly directed and
caused several Chevaux de Frize to be made and fix'd at the Gates and
Entrances to the City, to prevent his Majesty's Horse or Dragoons from
approaching it; that the Prisoner order'd some of the Rebel Army then in
Carlisle, to make a Sally out to bring in some Sheep, and that the Prisoner
mounted the Walls, with a Pistol in his Hand, to give Notice if the King's
Forces was near where the Men were to go; that the Prisoner paid the Men of
his own Company himself, as all the Captains of Companies did theirs; and that
he had heard the Prisoner, when in Carlisle in Company with other Officers,
complain that he was fourscore Pounds out of Pocket in paying his Men; that,
before the Capitulation, this Witness heard the Prisoner have some Words, and
was seemingly in a great Passion with Colonel Hamilton, who was Governor of
the Castle or Citadel of Carlisle, for surrendering the Place, and not making
a Defence to the last; and that he heard the Prisoner declare, that it was
better to die by the Sword, than to fall into the Hands of those damn'd
Hanoverians.

My Lord, the objection I make is this, that the Statute of 7 Ann, cap. 21.
sec. 11. requires, "that when any person is indicted for High Treason, a list
of the witnesses who shall be produced on the trial for proving the said
indictment, - of the Jury, mentioning the names, professions, and place of
abode, of the said witnesses and Jurors, shall be given at the same time that
the copy of the indictment is delivered to the party indicted, and that copies
of all Indictments for the offence aforesaid, with such lists, shall be
delivered to the party indicted, ten days before the trial."

opinion, that what the prisoner has himself said with reference to the

and the part he was taking, so as to shew that that insurrection and riot,
