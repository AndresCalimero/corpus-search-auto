But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

It seems that Sennacherib had, upon advice that Hirhakah King of Ethiopia was
come forth to make war with him, for awhile withdrawn his powers from Judea,
and marched out to give him battle: and having then defeated the allied army,
on which the Jews had placed no small confidence, he resumed his attempt upon
Jerusalem.

given without any determinate meaning They stand more especially obliged to
countenance and support this institution, by their personal attendance, and by
publick expressions of piety, that their light may shine before men; and that
the influence of their example, instead of misleading into sin, may bring many
to righteousness.

being a mere Mistake in Language; the real Question, which this is mistaken
for, will, I suppose, be answered by observing, that the Goodness of God
already exercised towards us, our present Dependance upon him, and our
Expectation of future Benefits, ought, and have a natural Tendency, to beget
in us the Affection of Gratitude, and greater Love towards Him, than the same
Goodness exercised towards others; were it only for this Reason, that every
Affection is moved in Proportion to the Sense we have of the Object of it;

Thus, then, I have endeavoured to point out that the course of things is so
arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another
and higher sphere of existence.

Now it has advantages for our soul's good, that we do live in a refined,
reading, intellectual, active age. Not, as I said, that nature can do the work
of grace, or that, without grace, these same things would not turn to evil or
be a snare to us, or minister the more fatally to self-deceit, or absorb us
out of the atmosphere of grace, or hide from us God and the invisible; nor
that some of our trials do not lie in them.

Our estimate of Sacraments $can $not be too high, if only we can keep it
proportionate and subordinate, if only it makes us know how surely we may then
have access with confidence to the Father through the Christ whose one desire
is to bring us to Him, how liberally the power of the Spirit works there to
communicate to us direct from the Christ the actual power of His life, that
Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith.

the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

itself, and depart from all sense of right, as in these enlightened days to
question the existence of a Deity, whose wonderful works are better known than

when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

themselves worthy, during their continuance here, to be elect of God, and be
made partakers of the first resurrection in Christ's kingdom. After which, at
the final consummation, all shall be raised; and all shall be judged by Christ
himself; and all shall be sentenced to happiness or to misery, according to
what they have done in the body, whether it be good or evil; when Christ,

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.
