We had not been many Days at Nottingham before we heard, that the Prince of
Denmark, with some other great Persons, were gone off, from the King, to the
Prince of Orange, and that the Princess Anne, fearing the King her $Father $'s
Resentment might fall upon her, for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her
self, in the Night, from London, and was then within half a Days Journey of
Nottingham; on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News, that
two thousand of the King's Dragoons were in close pursuit to bring her back
Prisoner to London:

a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have

Actor, insomuch that the best Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate

at once, those thundring Peals of Approbation, which a crouded Theatre throws
out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor, to raise and

It may surely with the highest Justice be expected, that the Title and Bravery
of Colonel Gardiner will invite many of our Officers and Soldiers, to whom his
Name has long been honourable and dear, to peruse this Account of him with
some peculiar Attention: In Consequence of which, it may be a Means of
increasing the Number, and brightening the Character, of those who are already
adorning their Office, their Country, and their Religion; and of reclaiming
those who will see rather what they ought to be, than what they are.

Her Second Son, the worthy Person of whom I am now to give a more particular
Account, was born at Carriden, in Linlithgow-Shire, on the 10th of January,
A.D. 1687-8, the memorable Year of that glorious Revolution which he justly
esteem'd among the happiest of all Events. So that, when he was slain in the
Defence of those Liberties, which God then by so gracious a Providence rescued
from utter Destruction, i.e. on the 21st of September 1745, he was aged 57
Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days.

I know very little of the Particulars of those wild, thoughtless, and wretched
Years, which lay between the 16th and 30th of his Life; except it be, that he
frequently experienced the Divine Goodness in renewed Instances, particularly
in preserving him in several hot Military Actions, in all which, he never
received so much as a Wound after this, forward as he was in tempting Danger;
and yet, that all these Years were spent in an entire Alienation from God, and
an eager Pursuit of Animal Pleasure, as his Supreme Good.

his Envoy there; because it was said, that in less than Six Weeks there would
be a Revolution, in favour of what they called the Family of the Stewarts.

But the Major was so little affected with what had befallen him, that when
some of his gay Friends, on hearing the Story, rallied him upon the Efficacy
of his Prayers, he excused himself from the scandal of being thought much in
earnest, by saying, "That it was at Midnight, an Hour when his good Mother and
Aunt were asleep; or else he should have left that Part of the Business to
them." A Speech, which I should not have mentioned, but as it shews in so
lively a view the wretch'd Situation of his Mind at that Time, though his
great Deliverance from the Power of Darkness was then nearly approaching.

And which I think deserves particular Remark though he assuredly believed that
he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,
and to that Blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a Manner set forth
as crucified before him.

And indeed, when I consider how habitual all those criminal Indulgences were
grown to him, and that he was now in the Prime of Life, and all this while in
high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very
Constitution, that he was used strangely to think, and to say, that
Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and
giving him another.

they are extinguished by the Sun - and Johnson with proven energy in his
expiring awful voice begging mercy at intervals of the Almighty.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

We decided to drop Greek entirely in the three lowest classes, with a view of
getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.
