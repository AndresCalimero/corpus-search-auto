Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by
his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he
could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling
and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding
both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them
by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr Pickwick from his
sleep.

me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me his tapestries, his
enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me wonder at the strange
loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and then told me that luxury was
nothing but a background, a painted scene in a play, and that power, power
over other men, power over the world, was the one thing worth having, the one
supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy one never tired of, and that in
our century only the rich possessed it.

But, my dear Lady Chiltern, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that in
practical life - Lady Chiltern smiling: Of which you know so little, Lord
Goring - Lord Goring: Of which I know nothing by experience, though I know
something by observation. I think that in practical life there is something
about success, actual success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about
ambition that is unscrupulous always.
