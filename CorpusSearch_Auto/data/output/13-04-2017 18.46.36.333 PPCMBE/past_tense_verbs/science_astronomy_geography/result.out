different kinds of matter, subject to a very few powers; and all disposed in
this strange and wonderful way, which gives to man a history - and such a
history - as to what there is in those veins, in those rocks, the ores, the
water springs, the atmosphere around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of forces in one great mass, 8000 miles in diameter,
that the mind is overwhelmed in contemplation of the wonderful history related

If I add a little liquid to the marble and decompose it, I get that which you
see - the Lecturer here put several lumps of marble into a glass jar, and
poured water and then acid over them; the carbonic acid immediately commenced
to escape with considerable effervescence - the appearance of boiling, which
is only the separation of one part of the marble from another.

In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new

But if we may be allowed so far to indulge the imagination, as to suppose a
being, entirely confined to the nether world - some "dusky melancholy sprite,
" like Umbriel, who could "flit on sooty pinions to the central earth," but
who was never permitted to "sully the fair face of light," and emerge into the
regions of water and of air; and if this being should busy himself in
investigating the structure of the globe, he might frame theories the exact
converse of those usually adopted by human philosophers.

uniformity in the laws regulating the changes of its surface, from the most

It was contrary to analogy to suppose, that Nature had been at any former
epoch parsimonious of time and prodigal of violence - to imagine that one

forces were not kept under subjection, so as never to carry simultaneous havoc
and desolation over the whole earth, or even over one great region.

In regard to the signs of upraising and sinking, of fracture and contortion in
rocks, it is evident that newer strata $can $not be shaken by earthquakes,
unless the subjacent rocks are also affected; so that the contrast in the

The rise of Dr. Franklin's fame in France was first occasioned by a bad
translation of his letters falling into the hands of Mr. Buffon, intendant of
the French King's gardens, and author of the Natural History for which he is

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

This maxim, that whatever the phial takes in at one surface it loses at the

whereby the fluid that was driven out by the first would be received by the
second, and what was driven out of the second would be received by the third,

The Abbe` says, "If any one should take upon him to prove, from a well
connected comparison of phenomena, that thunder is, in the hands of nature,
what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our
pleasure are little imitations of those great effects which frighten us, and
that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the
electrized body, and, at a certain proximity from that which is not; I avow
that this idea, if it was well supported, would give me a great deal of

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an

held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

In like manner, he says, when a hole is struck through a piece of pasteboard
by an electrified jar, if the surfaces of the pasteboard are not confined and
compressed, there will be a bur raised all round the hole on both sides of the
pasteboard; but that if one side be confined, so that the bur $can $not be
raised on that side, it will all be raised on the other side, which way soever
the fluid was directed.

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

In answer to the doubt of Mr. Kinnersley, whether the glass, or the sulphur
electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following
reasons. 1. Because, though the sulphur globe seemed to work equally well with
the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.
