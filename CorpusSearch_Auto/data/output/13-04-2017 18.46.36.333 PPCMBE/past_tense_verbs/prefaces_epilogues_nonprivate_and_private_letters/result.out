and from thence the Rear-Admiral would infer, the losing of his Maintop-Mast
as a Consequence. 2. That so soon as I had got clear of the Cornwal's
Weather-Quarter I luffed up, and fell upon the Cornwal's Weather-Bow. 3. That
I luffed up a second Time, when the Warwick was coming up. 4. That I was
ordered to bear down upon the Enemy just after the Cornwal withdrew; but that
I did not do so as I ought to have done, notwithstanding those Orders. 5. That
I fired upon the Strafford so long and so obstinately, that I did her great
Mischief; Altho' I had been several Times hailed by her. 6. And in general
that my Behaviour had been very bad during the Course of the Action, except
only at the Beginning.

When the Court considers that the Lenox lay close a-stern of the Cornwal,
whilst she continued in Action, so that when the Cornwal quitted the Line by
reason of her shortening and backening Sail, and the Lenox keeping her Course,
and busily employed in hot Action, it was morally impossible to avoid falling
foul of her one way or other. If any Blame lies on this Occasion, when the
Court takes into Consideration, that Part of my Weather Maintopsail Yard-Arm,
and the Head of my Foretop-Mast Staysail were shot away, with the other Damage
in my Rigging, whereby it became impracticable to manage the Ship so readily
as otherwise might be; and that the Cornwal's Maintop-Mast being shot away,
together with her shortening and backening Sail, I leave it to your Judgment
to determine on whom the Blame lies;

Sir, We humbly conceive it is our Duty to represent to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that in the Action between his Majesty's Squadron, and that
of Spain, which happened on the first of Octob. 1748, near the Havanna, that
by Rear-Admiral Knowles's bad Conduct, mistaken Signals, and $Un-Officerlike
Attack, he gave great Advantage to the Enemy; by engaging in a straggling Line
a superior Squadron drawn up in a close Line of Battle, late in the Day, when
he might have attacked them much earlier, and to greater Advantage. That his
Majesty's Ship Cornwal was not in the Action an Hour. That to the great
Dishonour of the British Flag, Rear-Admiral Knowles, not only unnecessarily
carried, but kept his Majesty's Flag out of Action. That he has endeavoured to
deceive his Majesty, their Lordships, and the Publick, by having transmitted a
false and injurious Account of the said Action, to Mr. Corbet, by Letter of
the 2d of October 1748; all which we are ready to prove,

My dear Sir Most heartily do I give you joy on the success of your 'Health at
Home' Education Mission - the enthusiastic attendance on your Lectures of
rural educated women from all over the County allowed to attend for their own
profit - your sifting & re-sifting till you obtained a Class of 12, who
appeared willing & able to become instructresses or missioners of Health to
the uneducated rural women at their own homes - the object of the whole course
being the new one not simply to give Sanitary information but to teach how to
teach - the examination by an independent well-known Sanitary authority - both
in writing & by word of mouth to test their power of speaking to the
uneducated And six of them passing the Exam'n with the utmost success three
indeed above what had been expected. the main object of the Exam'n being to
see not only if their book knowledge or theory were competent but if they
could give in the most practical & plainest, in the most lively & dramatic
manner - their knowledge to uneducated women in their own houses - translate
in fact the object-lessons they had received from your skill & kindness in the
worst houses of the worst villages - into the cottage life with their own
hands & tongue.

I then recommended that we should make over the French districts which should
fall into the hands of the Allies to officers to be appointed by the King of
France. That the intendants or principal Commissaries of the several armies
should be put in communication with these officers to be appointed by the King
of France, and should make upon them the requisitions for the several supplies
they should require for their armies respectively; that the King of $France
$'s officers should enforce these requisitions upon the country, taking care
to give to the owners proper receipts and vouchers for the property taken from
them; and that these receipts and vouchers should be taken up, and should be a
charge upon the French Government, to be hereafter established.

Allowing for much exaggeration in this account, and knowing that Buonaparte
can still collect, in addition to what he has brought back with him, the 5th

was at Wavre during the battle, and has not suffered so much as the others,
and probably some troops from La Vende`e, I am still of opinion that he can
