corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

Francis Drake to the North Part of the Coast of Peru, whence he continu'd his
Course still Northward, out at Sea, without ever touching, or coming in Sight
of the Coast of New Spain, 'till the 5th of June 1578, when being in the

which they tell us was not mountainous, and fell into a good Bay, in 38

The only Dutch-Man I meet with in these Parts, was George Spilbergen, who
having pass'd the Magellan Streights, in the Year 1615, and sail'd up the
Coast of Chile and Peru, as was there said, cross'd the Equinoctial and, on
the 20th of September, had sight of the Land of New Spain, in the Latitude of
13 Deg. 30 Min. then stood off to Sea, the Weather proving foul, and, October
the 1st, came in Sight of Land again; but the Sea still running high, beat off
and on 'till the 11th, when they enter'd the Port of Acapulco.
