taught in our Schools would not so far facilitate our Youths learning their
Latin and Greek Grammars, as to afford 'em spare-time for Arithmetic,

Thus, for instance, we commonly inoculate a fruitful bud or cion of an apricot
or peach into a plum stock, whose thriving, budding, putting forth branches,
&c. are in fact nothing more than the evident indexes of the action of the
seminal principles of those inoculated buds, which being set into motion, by
requisites duly concurring admit of the juice or sap of the bole, and becomes
fermental, dashing the preconceived seminal tincture of the stock, whereby it
was disposed to the putting on the form of a plum tree transmutes that juice
into its own nature, and so from the intestine strugglings of the said seminal
principles of the inoculated bud, proceeds the vegetation and growth of the
whole, clothing itself with all those natural liveries peculiar to the texture
of such seminal prolific principles.

The following is a short extract from a letter addressed to John Foster,
Chancellor of the Exchequer for Ireland, on Education for the Poor in that
Country: sold by Darton and Harvey, London: a tract I wish to recommend to the
perusal of the reader; and which, as well as the system of education, I am
happy to say has the marked approbation of the great and enlightened statesman
to whom I had the honor of addressing it.

Most of the observations made by that author will be found true; as they have
been confirmed by repeated experiments, by Dr Keil in England, the learned
Degorter in Holland and others; making a proper allowance for the different
climates they lived in, their different ages, ways of life, and constitutions.

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

If until the middle of the last century Japan was not exactly a sealed book to
the seeker after new forms of tree and plant life, the restrictions imposed
upon the members of other nationalities were such as to render it extremely

meadow or woodland, or plain or mountain, and bring away on their return home
the spoils of the exploration.

Among the Japanese trees and shrubs that have been introduced but have not as
yet been planted largely, mention may be made of Magnolia hypoleuca, which
attains noble proportions, but does not produce its handsome flowers freely
until it has attained a large size; the Japanese Horse-chestnut Aesculus
turbinata; the elegant Styrax japonicum; Betula Maximowiczi, a handsome Beech
remarkable for its large leaves and yellow bark; Quercus acuta, Q. glabra
latifolia, two Evergreen Oaks of merit.

With a fuller knowledge of the distinctive characteristics of the many
beautiful trees, shrubs, &c., that had been introduced from Japan, and the
increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the various phases of garden
design that had long found favour in that country, it is not surprising that a
strong desire should have been felt by many owners of gardens within the
British Isles to create gardens more or less in accordance with Japanese ideas.

stammer over a Chapter in the Bible, and before he has well lost the uncouth
Tone of Pronunciation, which he has perhaps learnt of his Mistress, he is

Language, and improving in the necessary Qualifications of reading it
distinctly, and with proper Emphasis, he is unreasonably enter'd upon a Latin
Grammar, and bewilder'd in unintelligible Jargon.
