The design of this and other like prophesies was to awaken that proud
luxurious people out of a state of unwarranted security - to make them
apprehensive of their real danger - to call off their trust from the arm of
flesh, from means merely human, their political wisdom and military power - to
direct their views to the Lord God of Hosts: to the end that they might feel
the necessity of humbling themselves under his mighty hand, and by the
reformation of their manners reconcile themselves to his favour, and engage
his protection.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

prolonging the war; while they artfully delude a proud infatuated nation into

formidable confederacy of the House of Bourbon, which may justly give an alarm

How many people are there, who, at an early age, leave their friends and their
country, to go into the most unpleasant and unhealthy situations - some into
the most intensely hot countries, and some into the coldest, with the
certainty of not returning till many of the best years of their life are past,
and with the great chance of either dying themselves before the time of their
return arrives, or at any rate of finding many of their dearest friends dead
before they have another opportunity of seeing them.

Thus, then, I have endeavoured to point out that the course of things is so
arranged as to make patience and industry the only means by which we can be
brought to any good, first of all in this life, and then in the life to come:
that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and
comfort, but also of fitting us to act our part in life with respectability,
of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these
tempers, may farther make us self-denying, obedient, faithful, that we may, by
degrees, be built up in godliness, and fitted to take our station in another
and higher sphere of existence.

But when we take a more practical view of the subject, and instead of looking
at the abstract character of these blessings, turn our attention to the real
change which they produce in our hearts and conduct; when we think of them not
as they ought to appear to us, but as they do, we are obliged to observe that,
in spite of all we know respecting God and His ways, we are nearly in all
respects the same persons as we should have been without this knowledge, and
that we should probably go on much in the same manner as we do, were our
religious creed no condition in the regulation of our conduct.

Now it has advantages for our soul's good, that we do live in a refined,
reading, intellectual, active age. Not, as I said, that nature can do the work
of grace, or that, without grace, these same things would not turn to evil or
be a snare to us, or minister the more fatally to self-deceit, or absorb us
out of the atmosphere of grace, or hide from us God and the invisible; nor
that some of our trials do not lie in them.

which the veil, which intercepted the light of Divine truth, has been removed

keenest intelligence, and strongest moral power, the instruments which He had
Himself formed in the natural order of things, to try their utmost and fail,

embraced Christianity; to exhort them to continue stedfast in the practice as
well as the profession of it: warning them of false teachers who would arise
in the bosom of the Church of Christ, and introduce erroneous doctrines into
it; as also, that "in the last days" there would be "scoffers, walking after
their own lusts;" who would blaspheme and deride Christianity, and set it at

Though far inferior to the Apostle in gifts, or knowledge of what may be the
designs of the Almighty; yet, as a veteran in your service, who feels daily
the weakness of declining years, and that he must not expect to be able often
to address you more from hence; he thinks he $can $not in any way better
employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the
belief of the Gospel promises; and fail of that blessed hope, to which while
strength has lasted he has endeavored to conduct you.

providential care of it, and of every individual in it: the Revelations he has
made of himself and of his will to mankind; to Adam, to the Patriarchs, to the
Israelites or Jews by Moses, and last of all by Jesus Christ his Son; whom he
sent in the nature and form of mortal man, to redeem mankind from sin and from
death; to proclaim pardon to us all, on repentance and amendment of life; to
assure us, through faith in him, of a resurrection to eternal life; and to
eternal happiness in that life, provided we exert our endeavors to live in
obedience to his commands during our continuance here; and with a promise,
that we shall receive the assistance of God's holy Spirit, if we seek and ask
it, to help our infirmities, and enable us to do what He expects us to strive

Indeed against them, it is proper from time to time to caution mankind:
because that is a corruption of Christianity expressly pointed out by Prophecy,
as what was to arise in the Church of Christ, and what is to continue for a
certain specific term and no longer: a corrupt Church, from whose Communion
God's "people" are exhorted to "come out" before its destruction; for that it
should come to an end and be destroyed with a signal destruction before the
coming of Christ to judgement.

itself, and depart from all sense of right, as in these enlightened days to
question the existence of a Deity, whose wonderful works are better known than

works of a voluminous French writer; who manifestly not from principle or
conviction, but merely for the sake of applause, had been sapping the
foundation of Revelation; little could it be imagined that the day would come,
when the ashes of that man should be brought in triumph from a distant country,
to be deposited in his native soil, whence he had been banished for unbelief;
and that a statue should be erected to his memory in a temple, and venerated
there with next to divine honours.

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their
having cast off all acknowledgement of Him.

To that end, I gave you an historical account of the origin and rise of the
Papal power. How, from being merely Bishops of Rome, a principal City, they
had gained an ascendency over other Bishops, and become temporal Princes: That
from an ambition, not peculiar to these Bishops of Rome but natural to man,
they had taken advantage of the ages of ignorance which followed the decline
of the Roman Empire, to advance their power; and gradually had established
many Practices in the church, of which neither the Scriptures themselves, nor
the example of early ages give us any intimation, nor for which any authority
can be traced.

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

Papist or Roman Catholic, derives the rule of Faith and Practice from the
