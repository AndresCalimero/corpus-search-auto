ivory ball, we take a mountain, and put a ball like this near it, we find that,
owing to the vast size of the mountain, as compared with the billiard ball,
the latter is drawn slightly towards it; showing clearly that an attraction
does exist, just as it did between the shell-lac which I rubbed and the piece

the law which governs its attraction for which, I think, I must take up a
little time at our next meeting, still I will put that word on the board, and
hope you will now remember that we have in some degree considered the force of
gravitation - that force which causes all bodies to attract each other when
they are at sensible distances apart, and tends to draw them together.

We have a second observation of the same satellite March 27, 1794; where,
among the glimpses of additional satellites at 11=h= 41 ',is mentioned" one in
a place probably agreeing with the new satellite of March 26th, "which, by its
motion, must have been carried forward, so as to be where the observation of
the 27th says it was, namely," a little farther off and after the 1st; "that
is, at a little greater distance from the planet than the 1st, and not so far
advanced in its orbit as that satellite.

the very margin of their planets, so as even to measure the apparent diameter

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

In regard to the signs of upraising and sinking, of fracture and contortion in
rocks, it is evident that newer strata $can $not be shaken by earthquakes,
unless the subjacent rocks are also affected; so that the contrast in the
relative degree of disturbance in the more ancient and the newer strata, is
one of many proofs that the convulsions have happened in different eras, and
the fact confirms the uniformity of the action of subterranean forces, instead
of their greater violence in the primeval ages.

caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the
Subapennine hills, now exclusively tropical, to retain no longer any
representatives in the adjoining seas, has also contributed to the

an alteration from what has been termed an "insular" to an "excessive" climate,
from one in which the temperature of winter and summer were nearly equalized

Though the English have not been backward in acknowledging the great merit of
this philosopher, he has had the singular good fortune to be, perhaps, even
more celebrated abroad than at home; so that to form a just idea of the great
and deserved reputation of Dr. Franklin, we must read the foreign publications
on the subject of electricity; in many of which the terms Franklinism,
Franklinist, and the Franklinian system occur in almost every page.

He had observed, that if two persons stood upon wax, one of which rubbed the
tube, and the other took the fire from it, they would both appear to be
electrified; that if they touched one another after that operation, a stronger
spark would be perceived between them, than when any other person touched
either of them; and that such a spark would take away the electricity of both.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

He says, that when a tube lined with any non-electric is rubbed, what is
collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

He also says, that when the gilding was varnished even with turpentine, this
varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was
driven through paper, it would be blackened by the smoke, which sometimes
penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the

The Abbe` says, "If any one should take upon him to prove, from a well
connected comparison of phenomena, that thunder is, in the hands of nature,
what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our
pleasure are little imitations of those great effects which frighten us, and
that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the
electrized body, and, at a certain proximity from that which is not; I avow
that this idea, if it was well supported, would give me a great deal of
pleasure;

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

He takes notice that, in these experiments, the needle, in some cases, would
be finely blued, like the spring of a watch, by the electric flame; in which
case the colour given by a flash from two jars only might be wiped off, but
that a flash from four jars fixed it, and frequently melted the needles.

concerning the sameness of electricity with the matter of lightning, was
waiting for the erection of a spire in Philadelphia to carry his views into
execution; not imagining that a pointed rod, of a moderate height, could
answer the purpose; when it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite,
he could have a readier and better access to the regions of thunder than by

In answer to the doubt of Mr. Kinnersley, whether the glass, or the sulphur
electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following
reasons. 1. Because, though the sulphur globe seemed to work equally well with
the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible

the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the

the gravest tone.
