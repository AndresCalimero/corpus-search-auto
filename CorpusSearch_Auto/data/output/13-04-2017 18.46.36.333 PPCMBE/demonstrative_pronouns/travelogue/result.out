But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first
castle at Deganwy. A warlike person, but whose habits of life were so loose
that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

background as the panelled walls of Pla`s Mawr, and to pass in and out of your
domain beneath $heavy-browed feudal gateways. Above all, to be Constable, as
the Mayors of Conway are, of King Edward's stately pile, and do its honours to
deputations of learned and distinguished bodies, who in these particulars are
among the great ones of the earth.

valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or

Had our Governors in North America imitated this bright example, and acquired
as great a popularity amongst all ranks of people where they presided, as this
venerable Hollander at the settlement of the Cape, there had been no occasion
for British swords to have been drawn, or British bayonets to have been
pointed at the breasts of fellow subjects and countrymen, who in the last most
glorious war bled at each other's side, brave and victorious warriors, in the
common cause of Great Britain and their Sovereign.

Whilst the Messages went forward and backward, to and from Mexico, and
Ferdinand Cortes prepar'd to advance to that City, Embassadors came to him,
from the neighbouring Province of Zempoala, to settle a strict Amity with him,
and declaring themselves mortal Enemies to the Mexicans, for their
Incroachments and Cruelty; which was very acceptable to Cortes, who, by this
Means, understood, that Motezuma was a haughty Tyrant, and as such hated by
his own Subjects, as well as Neighbours.

This News troubled Cortes, who enquiring farther, was inform'd, that the great
Men of Mexico appear'd discontented and thoughtful; that some of them had been

Spaniard had been privately carry'd to Motezuma, who order'd it to be hid; by
all which Tokens he was convinc'd, remembering the treacherous Practices of
that Monarch before his coming to Mexico, that he was resolv'd to destroy him

The only Dutch-Man I meet with in these Parts, was George Spilbergen, who
having pass'd the Magellan Streights, in the Year 1615, and sail'd up the
Coast of Chile and Peru, as was there said, cross'd the Equinoctial and, on
the 20th of September, had sight of the Land of New Spain, in the Latitude of
13 Deg. 30 Min. then stood off to Sea, the Weather proving foul, and, October
the 1st, came in Sight of Land again; but the Sea still running high, beat off
and on 'till the 11th, when they enter'd the Port of Acapulco.
