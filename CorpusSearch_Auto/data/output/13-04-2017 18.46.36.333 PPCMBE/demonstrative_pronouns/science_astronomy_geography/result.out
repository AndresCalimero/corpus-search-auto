intermitting fevers, when the bark and other remedies have failed, as I have
often experienced on several, both old and young; the use of which I will now
publish for the benefit of the poor and country people, who are remote from

And, when we come to dig into or examine it as man does for his own
instruction and advantage, in a variety of ways, we see that it is made up of
different kinds of matter, subject to a very few powers; and all disposed in
this strange and wonderful way, which gives to man a history - and such a
history - as to what there is in those veins, in those rocks, the ores, the
water springs, the atmosphere around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of forces in one great mass, 8000 miles in diameter,
that the mind is overwhelmed in contemplation of the wonderful history related
by these strata some of which are fine and thin like sheets of paper, - all
formed in succession by the forces of which I have spoken.

If I add a little liquid to the marble and decompose it, I get that which you
see - the Lecturer here put several lumps of marble into a glass jar, and
poured water and then acid over them; the carbonic acid immediately commenced
to escape with considerable effervescence - the appearance of boiling, which
is only the separation of one part of the marble from another.

a larger one, like that changing one of the balls for a much larger one, there
was much more of this attraction exerted; or, if I made this ball larger and

Having been lately much engaged in improving my tables for calculating the
places of the Georgian satellites, I found it necessary to recompute all my
observations of them.

In looking over the whole series, from the year of the first discovery of the
satellites in 1787 to the present time, I found these observations so
extensive, especially with regard to a miscellaneous branch of them, that I
resolved to make this latter part the subject of a strict examination.

In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

Having moreover calculated tables for reduction: for the position of the point

checking computations of this sort, I found many former intricacies vanish.

the very margin of their planets, so as even to measure the apparent diameter

itself, by means of the passage of the satellite over its disk.

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

It seems, therefore, fair to infer, that the same change of climate which has
caused certain Indian species of testacea to become rare, or to degenerate in
size, or to disappear from the Mediterranean, and certain genera of the
Subapennine hills, now exclusively tropical, to retain no longer any
representatives in the adjoining seas, has also contributed to the
annihilation of certain genera of land-mammifera, which inhabited the
continents at about the same epoch.

this philosopher, he has had the singular good fortune to be, perhaps, even
more celebrated abroad than at home; so that to form a just idea of the great

on the subject of electricity; in many of which the terms Franklinism,
Franklinist, and the Franklinian system occur in almost every page.

He had observed, that if two persons stood upon wax, one of which rubbed the
tube, and the other took the fire from it, they would both appear to be
electrified; that if they touched one another after that operation, a stronger
spark would be perceived between them, than when any other person touched
either of them; and that such a spark would take away the electricity of both.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

He says, that when a tube lined with any non-electric is rubbed, what is
collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

The Abbe` says, "If any one should take upon him to prove, from a well
connected comparison of phenomena, that thunder is, in the hands of nature,
what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our
pleasure are little imitations of those great effects which frighten us, and
that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the
electrized body, and, at a certain proximity from that which is not; I avow
that this idea, if it was well supported, would give me a great deal of

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

In answer to the doubt of Mr. Kinnersley, whether the glass, or the sulphur
electrified positively, the Doctor gave it as his opinion, that the glass
globe charged positively, and the sulphur negatively, for the following
reasons. 1. Because, though the sulphur globe seemed to work equally well with
the glass one, yet it could never occasion so large, and so distant a spark
between his finger and conductor as when the glass globe was used.

quantity of electric fluid which they have, and hold attracted within their

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.
