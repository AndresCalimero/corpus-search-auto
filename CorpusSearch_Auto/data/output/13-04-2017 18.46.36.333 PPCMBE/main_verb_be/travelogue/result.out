But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first

that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or

In speaking of the several Adventurers into the South Sea, we brought Sir
Francis Drake to the North Part of the Coast of Peru, whence he continu'd his
Course still Northward, out at Sea, without ever touching, or coming in Sight
of the Coast of New Spain, 'till the 5th of June 1578, when being in the
Latitude of 43 Degrees, and finding it very cold, he stood in for the Land,
which they tell us was not mountainous, and fell into a good Bay, in 38
Degrees Latitude.

Bearings of all the Coasts on the Back of America, from the Island of

Harbours, taken from the Spanish Coasting-Pilots, and other curious Cuts,
which, with several Curiosities, too tedious to be here taken Notice of, will
render the Work as useful, instructive, and diverting, as any Book of this
