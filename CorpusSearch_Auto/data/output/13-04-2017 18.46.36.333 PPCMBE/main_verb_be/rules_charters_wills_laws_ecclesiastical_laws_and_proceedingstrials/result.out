Whereas an act, passed in the last session of parliament, intituled, An act
for the relief of certain insolvent debtors, did not contain provision
adequate to the relief of all the persons to whom it was meant to extend, by
reason that several prisoners who were in custody on the first day of January
one thousand eight hundred and four, and had continued in custody from that
time to the time of the passing of the said act, and also until and at the
time of the making out of the lists, by the said act directed to be made,
during the time of such their imprisonment, $had been removed by writ of
Habeas Corpus, or by other means from one prison to another, after the said
first day of January one thousand eight hundred and four, and before the
making out of such lists; and also because the form of the lists by that act
required to be made and delivered by the several gaolers or keepers of prisons
within this kingdom, and the form of the oath by them severally in and by the
same act required to be taken, do not comprehend and apply to the case of
prisoners so removed as herein-before mentioned:

Whereas by an act, passed in the thirty-ninth and fortieth years of the reign
of his present Majesty, intituled, An act for erecting a lazaret on Chetney
Hill, in the county of Kent, and for reducing into one act the laws relating
to quarantine, and for making further provisions therein, and by other acts
antecedent thereto, provision was made as well for purchasing lands for
erecting a lazaret as for defraying the expences of building the same, and for
maintaining a proper establishment of officers necessary for enforcing a due
performance of quarantine; in pursuance of which, lands were purchased at
Chetney Hill, in the county of Kent, and progress was made in the erection of
a lazaret there; but the funds granted by the said act of the thirty-ninth and
fortieth years of his present Majesty having been found insufficient for
completing the same, and for the payment of competent salaries to the officers
who were to have the charge thereof, and other necessary expences attendant on
the quarantine service, according to the plan which had been approved of and
directed by his Majesty, by and with the advice of his privy council, a
further sum was granted by an act of the last session of parliament:

Francis Townley, late of the City of Carlisle, in the County of Cumberland,
Gent. was indicted for that he, with Andrew Blood and George Fletcher not
having the Fear of God in his Heart, nor regarding his Duty and Allegiance,
but, being moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil, as a false
Traitor against his most serene, illustrious and excellent Prince, George the
Second, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King,
Defender of the Faith, &c. his supreme, true, lawful, rightful, and undoubted
Sovereign Lord, the cordial Love, and due and true Obedience, Fidelity, and
true Allegiance, which every Subject of our said Lord the King ought to bear,
withdrawing, and utterly to extinguish, intending and contriving, and with all
his Force, purposing and designing the Government of these Kingdoms to subvert,
change, and alter; as also our said Lord the King, to Death, and final
Destruction to put and bring, and these Kingdoms into intolerable and
miserable Slavery to subdue and inthral; and to fix on the Imperial Throne of
these Realms, a Person called the Prince of Wales, in the Time of the late
King James the Second, &c.

I $do $n't doubt but, in the Course of our Evidence, we shall make it appear
to your Satisfaction, that the Prisoner with two others, whose Names are Blood
and Fletcher, and other their Confederates, did assemble in a warlike Manner,
and procured Arms, Ammunition, and other Instruments of War; and compos'd a
Regiment for the Service of the Pretender to these Realms, to wage War against
his present most sacred Majesty; and did march through and invade several
Parts of this Kingdom, and unlawfully did seize his Majesty's Treasure in many
Places for the Service of their villainous Cause, and took away the Horses and
other Goods, Merchandize, and Chattels of many of his Majesty's peaceable
Subjects. And that, during the said March, the Prisoner, with other Rebels in
open Defiance of his Majesty's undoubted Right and Title to the Crown of these
Realms, frequently caused the Pretender's Son to be proclaimed, $in a publick
and solemn Manner, as Regent of these Realms, and himself march'd at the Head
of a pretended Regiment which they call'd the Manchester Regiment.

Sir Richard Lloyd. Call Samuel Maddox, who appeared and was sworn, and said,
the first Time he saw the Prisoner Colonel Townley was at Manchester, about
the 6th, 7th, or 8th Day of December last, but the Day he could not
particularly remember and said the Prisoner was made Colonel of the Manchester
Regiment by the Pretender's Son; and one Reason why he was certain he was
Colonel of the Regiment, was, that a Guard from the said Regiment was mounted
every Day, and Centinels placed at the Prisoner's Quarters; that he the said
Maddox marched out with him in the Station of an Ensign, but never had any
Commission, tho' he carried the Colours as such; that the Prisoner wore a
Sword and a Brace of Pistols, with a white Cockade in his Hat, and that the
Prisoner gave Command as Colonel of the Regiment, and that he ordered the said
Manchester Regiment to be drawn up in the Church Yard, in Manchester, where
the Pretender's Son reviewed them, and that he marched at the Head of the
Regiment as Colonel to Derby.

This Witness farther depos'd, that when they were at Derby with the Rebel Army,
they beat up for Volunteers for the Manchester Regiment, commanded by the
Honourable Colonel Francis Townley, and that the same was done by the
particular Order and Direction of the Prisoner. That when the Rebel Army
retreated from Derby, Col. Townley the Prisoner, and some of his Regiment,
took out of a House between Derby and Ashborn, a Sack full of Arms, which were
concealed under some old Writings; that the said Arms were taken with them to
Ashborn, and lodg'd all Night in the Prisoner's own Room, and dispos'd of
afterwards among his Men; that the Prisoner had two Centinels always at his
Door all Night for fear the Duke of Cumberland was nearer to them then they
imagined; that the Prisoner march'd as Col. of the Manchester Regiment, in
their Retreat from Derby to Carlisle some Times at the Head of the Regiment;
that when they came to Carlisle, the Prisoner was made by the Pretender's Son
Commandant of Carlisle; and had another Commission given him by the
Pretender's Son to raise a Regiment of Horse; that so soon as the main Body of
the Rebel Army were gone from Carlisle for Scotland, he the Prisoner took on
him the Command of the whole Rebel Forces left there, and that he gave Orders
for the Guns to be mounted, and also ordered a House to be burnt; which was
accordingly done, alledging that several of the King's Forces had fired from
it, and annoyed the Pretender's Army; and that he particularly directed and
caused several Chevaux de Frize to be made and fix'd at the Gates and
Entrances to the City, to prevent his Majesty's Horse or Dragoons from
approaching it; that the Prisoner order'd some of the Rebel Army then in
Carlisle, to make a Sally out to bring in some Sheep, and that the Prisoner
mounted the Walls, with a Pistol in his Hand, to give Notice if the King's
Forces was near where the Men were to go; that the Prisoner paid the Men of
his own Company himself, as all the Captains of Companies did theirs; and that
he had heard the Prisoner, when in Carlisle in Company with other Officers,
complain that he was fourscore Pounds out of Pocket in paying his Men; that,
before the Capitulation, this Witness heard the Prisoner have some Words, and
was seemingly in a great Passion with Colonel Hamilton, who was Governor of
the Castle or Citadel of Carlisle, for surrendering the Place, and not making
a Defence to the last; and that he heard the Prisoner declare, that it was
better to die by the Sword, than to fall into the Hands of those damn'd
Hanoverians.

And the Prisoner's Council farther observed, that the Indictment was
insufficient, for that they had not mentioned the Day in the Indictment when
the Treason was done, and that by the glorious Statute of the 7th of King
William III. which was justly esteemed the Bulwark of English Liberty,
directed, that nothing shall be given in Evidence but what is inserted in the
Indictment, and that the Time not being mentioned in the Indictment when the
Treason was acted, is sufficient to quash it, because it might be so long past
as to intitle the Prisoner to the Benefit of the Limitation enacted in the
said King's Reign;

indictment, - of the Jury, mentioning the names, professions, and place of
abode, of the said witnesses and Jurors, shall be given at the same time that
the copy of the indictment is delivered to the party indicted, and that copies
