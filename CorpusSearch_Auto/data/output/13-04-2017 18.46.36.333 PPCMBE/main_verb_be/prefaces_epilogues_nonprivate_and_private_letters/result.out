When the Court considers that the Lenox lay close a-stern of the Cornwal,
whilst she continued in Action, so that when the Cornwal quitted the Line by
reason of her shortening and backening Sail, and the Lenox keeping her Course,
and busily employed in hot Action, it was morally impossible to avoid falling
foul of her one way or other. If any Blame lies on this Occasion, when the
Court takes into Consideration, that Part of my Weather Maintopsail Yard-Arm,
and the Head of my Foretop-Mast Staysail were shot away, with the other Damage
in my Rigging, whereby it became impracticable to manage the Ship so readily
as otherwise might be; and that the Cornwal's Maintop-Mast being shot away,
together with her shortening and backening Sail, I leave it to your Judgment
to determine on whom the Blame lies;

Sir, We humbly conceive it is our Duty to represent to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that in the Action between his Majesty's Squadron, and that
of Spain, which happened on the first of Octob. 1748, near the Havanna, that
by Rear-Admiral Knowles's bad Conduct, mistaken Signals, and $Un-Officerlike
Attack, he gave great Advantage to the Enemy; by engaging in a straggling Line
a superior Squadron drawn up in a close Line of Battle, late in the Day, when
he might have attacked them much earlier, and to greater Advantage. That his
Majesty's Ship Cornwal was not in the Action an Hour. That to the great
Dishonour of the British Flag, Rear-Admiral Knowles, not only unnecessarily
carried, but kept his Majesty's Flag out of Action. That he has endeavoured to
deceive his Majesty, their Lordships, and the Publick, by having transmitted a
false and injurious Account of the said Action, to Mr. Corbet, by Letter of
the 2d of October 1748; all which we are ready to prove,

I am the more Confident there could be no Reason for my doing so, because on
the second Day after the Action, viz. on the third of Oct. 1748, the

Warwick and Canterbury, and chase the Ships in Sight, but if I could not come
up with them before Night, be sure to join him again, that we might get
between the Havanna and them.

without of course giving your name, when you arrived from Souakim what you
told me, viz. that to make the Cocoatina acceptable, it should be combined
with milk & that the only Cocoa they the men liked was the cocoa & milk -

My dear Sir Most heartily do I give you joy on the success of your 'Health at

rural educated women from all over the County allowed to attend for their own
profit - your sifting & re-sifting till you obtained a Class of 12, who
appeared willing & able to become instructresses or missioners of Health to
the uneducated rural women at their own homes - the object of the whole course
being the new one not simply to give Sanitary information but to teach how to
teach - the examination by an independent well-known Sanitary authority - both
in writing & by word of mouth to test their power of speaking to the
uneducated And six of them passing the Exam'n with the utmost success three
indeed above what had been expected. the main object of the Exam'n being to
see not only if their book knowledge or theory were competent but if they
could give in the most practical & plainest, in the most lively & dramatic
manner - their knowledge to uneducated women in their own houses - translate
in fact the object-lessons they had received from your skill & kindness in the
worst houses of the worst villages - into the cottage life with their own
hands & tongue.

The modern tendencies seem to be to let out Nurses like Plumbers - for so many
hours a day to the Wards - Sisters or Head Nurses included - & then to let
them live for the remaining hours quite apart from the Hospital - wanting the
motherly element altogether - essential to a Nurse who is not a Plumber - but
has the care of soul & body in her Patients, & in her Assistant Nurses to
certify them as Plumbers. 2 to substitute the literary Nurse for the practical
Nurse who is to be raised by the moral side quite as much as by the technical
side - to have a spirit put into her quite as much as a hand.

It was I who recommended to the King to enter France at present, because I was
aware of the extent of our success in the battle of the 18th, and because I
was desirous of having the influence of his Majesty's name to give to that
success all the advantages which it could derive; and because I was aware that
it would occasion a crisis in the King's affairs, particularly at Paris, to
take advantage of which I wished His Majesty should be on the spot, or as near
it as circumstances would permit.
