of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within

which, when truly merited, is perhaps, one of the most agreeable

Actor, insomuch that the best Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate
Admirers may be, yet, to unite them into one general Act of Praise, to receive
at once, those thundring Peals of Approbation, which a crouded Theatre throws
out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor, to raise and

Name has long been honourable and dear, to peruse this Account of him with
some peculiar Attention: In Consequence of which, it may be a Means of
increasing the Number, and brightening the Character, of those who are already

Her Second Son, the worthy Person of whom I am now to give a more particular
Account, was born at Carriden, in Linlithgow-Shire, on the 10th of January,
A.D. 1687-8, the memorable Year of that glorious Revolution which he justly
esteem'd among the happiest of all Events. So that, when he was slain in the
Defence of those Liberties, which God then by so gracious a Providence rescued
from utter Destruction, i.e. on the 21st of September 1745, he was aged 57
Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days.

the Account of them by observing, that, on the 24th of January 1729-30, he was

Officer was also honoured for many Years.

he should ere long be in Hell, and settled it as a Point with himself for
several Months, that the Wisdom and Justice of God did almost necessarily
require, that such an enormous Sinner should be made an Example of everlasting
Vengeance, and a Spectacle as such both to Angels and Men, so that he hardly
durst presume to pray for Pardon; yet what he then suffered, was not so much
from the Fear of Hell, though he concluded it would soon be his Portion, as
from a Sense of that horrible Ingratitude he had shown to the God of his Life,
and to that Blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a Manner set forth
as crucified before him.

a Religious Education; after having been hardned, rather than subdued, by the
most singular Mercies, even various, repeated, and astonishing Deliverances,
which have appeared to themselves as no less than miraculous; after having
lived for Years without God in the world, notoriously corrupt themselves, and
labouring to the utmost to corrupt others, have been stopt on a sudden in the
full Career of their Sin, and have felt such Rays of the Divine Presence, and
of Redeeming Love, darting in upon their Minds, almost like Lightning from
Heaven, as have at once rouzed, over-powered, and transformed them: So that
they have come out of their Secret Chambers with an irreconcilable Enmity to
those Vices, to which, when they entered them, they were the tamest and most
abandoned Slaves; and have appeared from that very Hour the Votaries, the

asked the hour, they told him six, he answered, all went on regularly, he felt
he had but a few hours to live, every thing rushed into mind, all the
accompaniments, the expiring rush light, as day begins to break, the

day, the Stars twinkling like gems, as if they were doing their utmost before
they are extinguished by the Sun - and Johnson with proven energy in his
expiring awful voice begging mercy at intervals of the Almighty.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

I should have at once considered the waters of the Lac de Chede to be
cupriferous, had it not been for their excessive clearness, and for the
presence of numerous water serpents, one of which we caught as it was twisting
about among the grass and reeds near the shore, holding its head well above
water. About 14 inches long I believe there are some nearly a yard, belly
yellow, back yellow with green chequers, head green with a yellow ring round
its neck, and two black triangular spots on the ring with their points
directed down the back.

He said a Bill for the easier and speedier trial of the rebels that are taken
and shall be taken was passed yesterday, but it was very much opposed by the
Tories and Mr. Letchmere, who when it was just ready to pass, after it was
engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the
principal Whigs who were very angry with him for abusing the House so.

chief merit, that he did not realise the least the deadly character of his own
admissions against hostels, and proceeds at the end to suggest improvements.

if it $can $not be helped, to have them with eyes opened as being the best
that can be got, instead of whitewashing the sepulchre.

We decided to drop Greek entirely in the three lowest classes, with a view of
getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.
