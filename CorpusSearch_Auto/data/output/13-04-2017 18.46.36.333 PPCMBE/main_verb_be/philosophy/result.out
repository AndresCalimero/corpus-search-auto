So far, my aim hath been to make thee recognize that the power of the bad
which shocked thee so exceedingly is no power; to make thee see that those of
whose freedom from punishment thou didst complain are never without the proper
penalties of their unrighteousness; to teach thee that the licence which thou
prayedst might soon come to an end is not long-enduring; that it would be more
unhappy if it lasted longer, most unhappy of all if it lasted for ever;
thereafter that the unrighteous are more wretched if unjustly let go without
punishment than if punished by a just retribution - from which point of view
it follows that the wicked are afflicted with more severe penalties just when
they are supposed to escape punishment. '

So whether fate is accomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of
providence, or by a soul, or by the service of all nature - whether by the
celestial motion of the stars, by the efficacy of angels, or by the many-sided
cunning of demons - whether by all or by some of these the destined series is
woven, this, at least, is manifest: that providence is the fixed and simple
form of destined events, fate their shifting series in order of time, as by
the disposal of the Divine simplicity they are to take place. Whereby it is
that all things which are under fate are subjected also to providence, on
which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain things which are set under
providence are above the chain of fate - viz, those things which by their
nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly fixed, and lie outside the
order of fate's movements.

For as the innermost of several circles revolving round the same centre
approaches the simplicity of the midmost point, and is, as it were, a pivot
round which the exterior circles turn, while the outermost, whirled in ampler
orbit, takes in a wider and wider sweep of space in proportion to its
departure from the indivisible unity of the center - while, further, whatever
joins and allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a like simplicity, and no
longer expands vaguely into space - even so whatsoever departs widely from
primal mind is involved more deeply in the meshes of fate,

I have been employed hitherto in proving that the power of the wicked, which
appeared to you the most shameful thing in the universe, is, in reality,
nothing; that their wickedness never escapes unpunished, punished,
notwithstanding the disagreeable idea you entertained to the contrary: that
their liberty to do evil, which you wished might soon come to an end, is not
of long duration: that the longer it continues, they are so much the more
miserable; and that if it were to continue for ever, their misery would be
infinite: that, in fine, if the wicked escaped by an unjust exemption from
punishment, they would be more unhappy than if they were chastised according
to their demerits; and consequently, that they are never more rigorously
punished, than when they are supposed not to suffer for their crimes,

nature, or by the influence of the stars, or by the power of angels, or the
