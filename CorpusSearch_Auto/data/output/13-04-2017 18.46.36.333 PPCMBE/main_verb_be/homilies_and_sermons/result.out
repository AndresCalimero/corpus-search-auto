The design of this and other like prophesies was to awaken that proud
luxurious people out of a state of unwarranted security - to make them
apprehensive of their real danger - to call off their trust from the arm of
flesh, from means merely human, their political wisdom and military power - to
direct their views to the Lord God of Hosts: to the end that they might feel
the necessity of humbling themselves under his mighty hand, and by the
reformation of their manners reconcile themselves to his favour, and engage
his protection.

But, from many internal evidences contained in this chapter, compared with
several circumstances mentioned in other parts of Scripture, we may in general,
upon good grounds, collect that this Call was made in the reign of King
Hezekiah - after the Reformation of Religion in the Jewish Church, and the
reestablishment of the State - after his successful war with the Philistines,
- and after the recovery of the territories, which, in the time of his father
Ahaz, were torn away from Judah - after the destruction and captivity of
Israel by Shalmaneser King of Assyria - after his shaking off the yoke of
Subjection to the Assyrian - after the strengthening of Jerusalem in an
extraordinary manner by all kinds of military provision - before the
degradation and punishment of Shebna, the Treasurer, who was over the House -
before the advancement of Eliakim into his Post - and therefore before the
advancing of Sennacherib against Jerusalem after his success in other attempts
- before the Embassy of Rabshakeh in defiance of the God of Israel: at which
time we find that Eliakim was in fact invested in the title and office, which
was before possessed by Shebna: so that, upon the whole, it appears to have
been in the 14th year of Hezekiah 's reign, that year in which Sennacherib
came up against the fenced cities of Judah and took them - at which time
Hezekiah, under the apprehension of the common danger, did submit to pay three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold to the perfidious Prince;
who received the money, but broke his faith, and renewed the invasion - that
year in which Hezekiah was sick unto death - in which he was favoured with a
miraculous assurance of his recovery and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the
Assyrian power.

come forth to make war with him, for awhile withdrawn his powers from Judea,
and marched out to give him battle: and having then defeated the allied army,
on which the Jews had placed no small confidence, he resumed his attempt upon

Thus, though two Men should have the Affection of Compassion in the same
Degree exactly; yet one may have the Principle of Resentment, or of Ambition
so strong in him, as to prevail over that of Compassion, and prevent its
having any Influence upon his Actions; so that he may deserve the Character of
an hard or cruel Man: Whereas the other, having Compassion in just the same
Degree only, yet having Resentment or Ambition in a lower Degree, his
Compassion may prevail over them, so as to Influence his Actions, and to
denominate his Temper compassionate. So that, how strange soever it may appear
to People who do not attend to the thing, yet it is quite manifest, that, when
we say one Man is more Resenting or Compassionate than another, this does not
necessarily imply that one has the Principle of Resentment or of Compassion
stronger than the other.

being a mere Mistake in Language; the real Question, which this is mistaken

Expectation of future Benefits, ought, and have a natural Tendency, to beget
in us the Affection of Gratitude, and greater Love towards Him, than the same

How many people are there, who, at an early age, leave their friends and their
country, to go into the most unpleasant and unhealthy situations - some into
the most intensely hot countries, and some into the coldest, with the
certainty of not returning till many of the best years of their life are past,
and with the great chance of either dying themselves before the time of their
return arrives, or at any rate of finding many of their dearest friends dead
before they have another opportunity of seeing them.

that they are the appointed means, not only of securing to us subsistence and

of making us just, firm, honest, temperate: and that they have been appointed,
in order that the pains we are obliged to take in order to acquire these

It will thus be seen that the advantage which may be derived from the
knowledge of the fact, has a necessary dependance on the habitual religious
condition of the persons to whom it is communicated; and that the process by
which we are to take advantage of it, is a discipline just of the same sort as
that which we undergo in forming virtuous habits; so that to create a strong
impression on the mind, far from being the object of the Dispensation,
scarcely enters into its design: and if in any instance it accidentally
effects this, yet that by so doing it no more fulfils its final purpose, than
the excitement of good impulses completes a virtuous character.

For men are, unconsciously, living mere natural lives, without effort, without
aim, without struggle, without victory, without compass, without lode-star,
crossing the perilous sea of this world, where countless souls are shipwrecked,
without any consciousness of peril, or any desire except to escape
unrespectable sins, such as, they hope, that a moderate share of six deadly
sins, pride, covetousness, gluttony, luxury, envy, anger, is not, nor an
entire possession by the seventh, sloth, as far as it is spiritual.

It tells us of another ground of understanding or not understanding the mind
of God, - whether a man have "received the spirit of the world," or "the
Spirit of God, to perceive the things freely given us by God;" whether a man
have simply his natural powers, be he, thus far, as highly gifted as God has
ever created the keenest intellect of man, or whether he be illumined by the
Spirit of God; whether he would, of himself, know the mind of God and teach
Him, as men make their "moral sense" the interpreter of Divine truth, or
whether he "have" himself "the mind of Christ," being taught of Himself to
understand Him.

hast abused against Himself to sin; Whose love, every selfish injury of
another's soul has wounded in its tenderest depth; to Whose aweful justice
thou art absolutely responsible; Whose individual loving-kindness for thee, in
every rejection of any known motion of grace thou hast despised; Whose temple
in thee, if thou broughtest unclean thoughts into thy soul much more if there

thou saidst in fact, "I will not have Thee to reign over me."

employ the present opportunity, than by taking the frame of this Epistle for
his model, and speaking freely to you: recalling to your minds the principal
points of that, which, during above twenty years close attention to you and
watching over you, he has endeavoured to inculcate; warning you of what is to
come upon the world in due time; and cautioning you, "lest, being led astray"
by the error of the wicked, you should fall from your stedfastness in the

supposition that on account of their profession of Faith, they are secure of
happiness eternal, however they may behave; and which does lead others of

Indeed against them, it is proper from time to time to caution mankind:
because that is a corruption of Christianity expressly pointed out by Prophecy,
as what was to arise in the Church of Christ, and what is to continue for a
certain specific term and no longer: a corrupt Church, from whose Communion
God's "people" are exhorted to "come out" before its destruction; for that it
should come to an end and be destroyed with a signal destruction before the
coming of Christ to judgement.

Though I have been zealous to guard you against the contagion, which by
destroying all the principles of religion, all hope of another life, must tend
to confound the distinction between right and wrong, and undermine the
foundation of Government and good order among men; little was it to be
expected we should see the day, when one of the most polished, and seemingly
most obsequious and best regulated of nations, should become a pattern of
Anarchy; a horrid example to mankind of cruelty and more than savage barbarity;
a Mark certainly of the displeasure of the Almighty upon them, for their

the final consummation, all shall be raised; and all shall be judged by Christ
himself; and all shall be sentenced to happiness or to misery, according to
what they have done in the body, whether it be good or evil; when Christ,
having accomplished all things, shall "give up the Kingdom to God the Father,
" that "God may be all in all."

shall we, who know that no assessments can be imposed upon the lowest orders
among us, but what must be laid in due proportion upon those who appoint the
assessment, and must be paid by them in like proportion too; and that
therefore, if there were not other reasons, it is best for the lowest, that
property should be the measure of the ruling powers? shall we, who already
have a Government, long since the envy of other nations; formed gradually from
the experience of centuries; and adapted to the turn of the people, and the
turn of the people and their minds and their habits long adapted to it; a
Government, under which this nation has thriven so exceedingly, and become in
wealth and importance one of the first of nations; - Shall we barter all these

Suffice it, for the present, to say, that Books being scarce, and few persons
able to read, what little learning there was in those days, centered almost
wholly among the Clergy; and that they, living in a profligate age, were not
such patterns of righteousness, as Christian Bishops and Christian Preachers
should endeavor to be: That the Holy Scriptures having been translated early
into the Latin tongue, the language then spoken at Rome, the Service of the
church was in that language too: and, as the Papal power extended itself over
other countries, the service of all the Western Church $became conducted in
that language in every nation, though totally unintelligible to the people.

People; so Christ was considered in the Popish Mass, as sacrificed anew for
the living and the dead. Whence came repeated Masses to be celebrated by their
priests, though alone, for the people absent; and for the dead themselves,
whose souls were supposed to be relieved thereby from the pains of Purgatory.
