and yet we know that such is the case, because if, instead of taking a small
ivory ball, we take a mountain, and put a ball like this near it, we find that,
owing to the vast size of the mountain, as compared with the billiard ball,
the latter is drawn slightly towards it; showing clearly that an attraction
does exist, just as it did between the shell-lac which I rubbed and the piece
of paper which was over turned by it.

the law which governs its attraction for which, I think, I must take up a
little time at our next meeting, still I will put that word on the board, and
hope you will now remember that we have in some degree considered the force of
gravitation - that force which causes all bodies to attract each other when
they are at sensible distances apart, and tends to draw them together.

was much more of this attraction exerted; or, if I made this ball larger and

In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

After having been used to follow up the satellites of Saturn and Jupiter, to
the very margin of their planets, so as even to measure the apparent diameter
of one of Jupiter's satellites by its entrance on the disk, I was in hopes
that a similar opportunity would soon have offered with the Georgian
satellites: not indeed to measure the satellites, but to measure the planet
itself, by means of the passage of the satellite over its disk.

literati now engaged in exploring the antiquities of Egypt, had visited that
country with a firm belief that the banks of the Nile were never peopled by
the human race before the beginning of the nineteenth century, and that their
faith in this dogma was as difficult to shake as the opinion of our ancestors,
that the earth was never the abode of living beings until the creation of the
present continents, and of the species now existing, -

He who has observed the quarrying of stone from a rock, and has seen it
shipped for some distant port, and then endeavours to conceive what kind of
edifice will be raised by the materials, is in the same predicament as a
geologist, who, while he is confined to the land, sees the decomposition of
rocks, and the transportation of matter by rivers to the sea, and then
endeavours to picture to himself the new strata which Nature is building
beneath the waters.

If we were inhabitants of another element - if the great ocean were our domain,
instead of the narrow limits of the land, our difficulties would be
considerably lessened; while, on the other hand, there can be little doubt,
although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the bare suggestion of such an idea,
that an amphibious being, who should possess our faculties, would still more
easily arrive at sound theoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold,
on the one hand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, and the
transportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine the
deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal remains in new
strata.

But, if we suppose the change to have been extremely slow, and to have
consisted, not so much in a diminution of the mean annual temperature, as in
an alteration from what has been termed an "insular" to an "excessive" climate,
from one in which the temperature of winter and summer were nearly equalized
to one wherein the seasons were violently contrasted, we may, perhaps, explain
the phenomenon.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

it not that every bottle receives the new fire, and loses its old with some

varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was

penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the

what electricity is in ours, that the wonders which we now exhibit at our

that the whole depends upon the same mechanism; if it is to be demonstrated,
that a cloud, prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of
exhalations, &c. is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that
if the needle, when it was struck, lay East and West, the end which was
entered by the electric blast pointed North, but that if it lay North and
South, the end which lay towards the North, would continue to point North,
whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined, that
a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an
effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning.

answer the purpose; when it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite,

Dr. Franklin, retaining the common opinion, that electrified bodies have real
atmospheres of the electric fluid consisting of particles at some distance
from the surface of the body, but always going along with it observed that
these atmospheres and the air did not seem to exclude one another; though, he
says, this be difficult to conceive, considering that they are generally
supposed to repel one another.

Observations conducted about ten years ago upon the manner of bending of
bell-shaped bodies - waste-paper baskets and various structures of flexible
material - led me to think that these shapes were especially stiff as regards
the principal mode of bending with four nodal meridians to forces applied
normally and near the rim, and that possibly one of the objects of the
particular form adopted for bells might be to diminish the preponderance of
the gravest tone.
