It is evident by Experience, that there are several Arts and Sciences, which
$can $not be learn'd in any great Perfection, without the Knowledge of Latin,
or Greek, or other Antient Languages. Upon which Account it must be confess'd,
that those Persons. who design to Study such Arts or Sciences, ought to be
very well acquainted with these Languages; seeing an imperfect Knowledge of
them, only serves for Ostentation amongst the Ignorant, but is of no great
real use or Advantage.

Making the Latin Tongue by Conversation, the Vulgar Language of the Country,

was commonly spoke, instead of Italian: Which if true, is a plain Argument,

rheumatism, such painful affections of the muscular fibres, membranes, and

tumor or inflammation, but are very liable to shift suddenly from one part to
another, and are readily propagated along the course of the membranes and

that it is only in the protracted chronic rheumatism, where the vital powers

arsenic is likely to prove eminently successful.

interested in politics, religion, science, history, literature; who knows
enough to wish to know more, and to listen if he $can $not talk; a person who
is not at the mercy of a new book, a leading article, or the chatter of an
irresponsible outsider; a person who is not insular, provincial, narrow-minded,

boys who hate knowledge and think books dreary, who are perfectly
self-satisfied and entirely ignorant, and, what is worse, not ignorant in a

only satisfied to be so, but thinking it ridiculous and almost unmanly that a

$'T $is contrary to Sense and Reason says an able Judge in this Case to put
our English Youth to toil in foreign Languages, while our own Excellent
Language lies neglected, as if it were savage and unfit to entertain the
Liberal Arts and Sciences; whereas, if we would take care to polish and adorn
our Language, we should find it as capable of being the Receptacle and
Repository of Learning, as those that are call'd the Learned Languages.

spirit, to pursue a path, which is no less hazardous than it is honourable.

an artificial transplanting of those trees, just the same as though they were

whereby the seminal principles concentred in the seed, or contracted into
those prolific buds, are put into their proper matrix, which, with other

Thus, for instance, we commonly inoculate a fruitful bud or cion of an apricot
or peach into a plum stock, whose thriving, budding, putting forth branches,
&c. are in fact nothing more than the evident indexes of the action of the
seminal principles of those inoculated buds, which being set into motion, by
requisites duly concurring admit of the juice or sap of the bole, and becomes
fermental, dashing the preconceived seminal tincture of the stock, whereby it
was disposed to the putting on the form of a plum tree transmutes that juice
into its own nature, and so from the intestine strugglings of the said seminal
principles of the inoculated bud, proceeds the vegetation and growth of the
whole, clothing itself with all those natural liveries peculiar to the texture
of such seminal prolific principles.

and when they begin to increase their Family; for which End they lay their
Eggs in Cells, and go abroad to fetch in that Stuff commonly called Bee-Bread,

movement, such as writing, the integrity of a great number of parts is
necessary - the will, motor and sensory nerve-fibres, certain ganglia situate
upon the nerve-trunks, the cerebellum, the muscles, and the special senses -
goes on to say that in the disease in question 'it $can $not be doubted that
some changes take place in the nutrition of the parts through which the lines
of nerve action, regulating the secondarily automatic movements, run.

in order, then to guard the inexperienced against impositions of this sort, it
will be necessary to apprise such, that a colt is foaled without teeth; in a
few days, he puts out four, which are called pincers, or nippers; soon after,
appear the four separators, next to the nippers; it is sometimes three or four
months before the next, called the corner teeth, push forth; these twelve
colt's teeth, in the front of the mouth, continue without alternation, till
the colt is two years and a half old, which makes it difficult, without great
care, to avoid being imposed upon during that interval, if the seller finds it
his interest to make the colt pass for either younger or older than he really
is; the only rule you then have to judge by is his coat, and the hairs of his
mane and tail.

and as colds are generally the forerunners of most disorders, I shall begin
with observations on Colds and Coughs: in doing which, it will be proper to
remark, that by the wonderful mechanism of nature, in the formation of animals,
innumerable pipes and vessels are contrived, as so many canals, through which
the blood and humours constantly circulate, when the animal is in a perfect
state of health, and that numberless exceeding fine particles are continually
flying off from the surface of such bodies, either in the form of vapour, or
that of a fluid.

The blood being constantly propelled towards the excretory pores of the skin,
by the constant dilation and contraction of the arteries, is the cause of
perspiration; besides which, there is an internal heat, or rarifying virtue,
that expands the fluids, opens the pores, and resolves moisture into exceeding
fine vapours, from which it is easy to infer, that the greater the force is,
by which the blood or humours are driven to the surface of the body of any

While some are of opinion that the lampass should be left to itself, without
attempting a cure, and others burn the part with a red hot iron, causing the
teeth, by the time the horse has reached his twelfth year, to appear long, the
gums having the appearance of shrinking therefrom, so that a dealer might pass
him for one at sixteen, I will, in as brief a manner as I am able, describe my
method of treating the lampass, which gives immediate relief when dexterously
executed, and preserves the horse's mouth from the very unpleasant marks
occasioned by the application of a red hot iron as already noticed.

If until the middle of the last century Japan was not exactly a sealed book to
the seeker after new forms of tree and plant life, the restrictions imposed
upon the members of other nationalities were such as to render it extremely

meadow or woodland, or plain or mountain, and bring away on their return home
the spoils of the exploration.

One of the principal rules governing the work of the landscape gardener in
Japan is to follow nature as far as is practicable, and to arrange the
arborescent and other forms of plant life in their natural associations. That
is to say, plants which in a state of nature have their home on the mountain
side are not to be brought down to those parts of the garden which represent
the lowlands, and, it may be, used in the formation of a flowery fringe to
running stream or silent pool.

of some branch of knowledge, the speculations of antecedent philosophers, or
his own, while the office of the audience is only to attend to him, to listen,
to receive, think on, and treasure up what the speaker delivers, without being
called upon themselves to take any active part; without being required to
produce, to test, or to apply the knowledge thus acquired.

In another mode of teaching, the learner has not merely to listen, but to do
something himself; not merely to receive, but to produce his knowledge: - as
when the mathematical student proves the proposition which is enunciated by
his teacher, or solves a problem proposed to him; - or when the classical
scholar renders Horace or Thucydides into English.
