some of the Commanders return'd to their Ships before the Council came to any
Conclusion, and the rest resolv'd to sail to the Isthmus; by which means the

He farther added, that the Fight at the Isthmus would be in an open Sea,
whereas it was a manifest Advantage to them, who had the fewer Ships, to
determine the Matter in the Straits; and that if they sail'd from thence, they
should inevitably loose Aegina, Megara, and Salamis, whereas by staying where
they then were, they should not only save those Places, but sufficiently
defend the Isthmus, which the Barbarians should not so much as once look upon,
if the Grecians got the Victory at Sea.

And if we consider, that she had for Enemies, France and Spain, the Pope, and

supported by all those Powers, in her Pretensions to her Crown; that her own
Roman-Catholick Subjects wish'd to have her dethroned, and were often in Plots
for that Purpose, in which they were encourag'd by foreign Powers, that the
Irish, who were strongly attach'd to the Pope, were rebellious, and occasion'd
many intestine Commotions in that Kingdom: And yet that in the Midst of all
she, without any Allies, supported herself thro' a long and glorious Reign:
defeated all the Projects of her Enemies, and kept the Crown unshaken on her
Head to the last, purely by her good Policy, and the Affection, Zeal and
Loyalty of her faithful Subjects, whom by her wise Behaviour she attach'd
firmly to her Interest: I say, if we consider all these Things, her vast and

Charles's Design was to amuse Elizabeth and all the Protestants, particularly
the Huguenots, with whom he had made a perfidious Peace till he had drawn them
into the Snare, in order to destroy them by Treachery, when he found it
difficult to do it by open Force; which accordingly happened the next Year in
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, in which Admiral Chatillon, and all those
Huguenots who had been drawn to Court under Pretence of celebrating the
Nuptials of the King of Navarre with Charles's Sister, were inhumanly
butcher'd; tho' there were still enough left to occasion him further Trouble.

assisting the Huguenots, and she being willing to gain Time, that she might
penetrate farther into the Designs of her Enemies; so that the Huguenots could
not tell what to make of their good Protectress, who had even gone so far as
to stand Godmother to Charles's new-born Daughter, after the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; which might make one believe, that her Zeal for the Protestant
Religion was always subordinate to her private Interest. Tho' this must be
