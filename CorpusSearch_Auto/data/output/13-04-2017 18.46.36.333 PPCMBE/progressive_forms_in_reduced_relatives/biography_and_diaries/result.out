That while he is conscious, that, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands
of Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in
a settled Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even
offending the lowest Enemy, who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may publickly
revenge it. That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his
Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.
