But the best road to the bridge and Llandudno junction - synonymous terms -
strikes the river close to the village of Deganwy, which will assuredly detain
us for a time. Not because it is adjacent to one of the best golf links in
Wales and contains a delightfully situated and comfortable hotel; I hope I
know my duty better than that. Nor yet because as an architectural creation it
commends itself in the faintest degree to any of the artistic senses.

Towards Llandudno and the Orme, a couple of miles away, a pleasant sandy shore
divides the sea from wild commons all aglow with gorse and bracken, rolling
here into sand-hills where tufty, bent grass quivers precariously in the wind,
or sinking there into cuppy, sheltered hollows where sheep nibble upon soft
carpets of immemorial turf; while in the north the great mass of the Orme
rises grimly out of the sea from its encircling fringe of foam.

Maelgwyn, a Prince of North Wales in the sixth century, erected the first
castle at Deganwy. A warlike person, but whose habits of life were so loose
that when the yellow plague, engendered, it is said, by the festering unburied
corpses of unnumbered men slain in battle, struck this region, he shut himself
up in the little church of Llanrhos standing over yonder on the next ridge,
terrified at the thought of his past life.

But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the
very Welsh.

Had our Governors in North America imitated this bright example, and acquired
as great a popularity amongst all ranks of people where they presided, as this
venerable Hollander at the settlement of the Cape, there had been no occasion
for British swords to have been drawn, or British bayonets to have been
pointed at the breasts of fellow subjects and countrymen, who in the last most
glorious war bled at each other's side, brave and victorious warriors, in the
common cause of Great Britain and their Sovereign.

Bearings of all the Coasts on the Back of America, from the Island of
California, to the Streights of Magellan, Draughts of many considerable
Harbours, taken from the Spanish Coasting-Pilots, and other curious Cuts,
which, with several Curiosities, too tedious to be here taken Notice of, will
render the Work as useful, instructive, and diverting, as any Book of this

erected by the order of some prefect so called.
