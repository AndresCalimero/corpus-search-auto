Grecians should possess themselves of the Streights of Thermopylae, which were
the only Passage out of Thessaly into Greece, and more easy to be maintain'd
by their small Numbers, than any other; wherefore Leonidas, King of Sparta,
was sent hither with 5000 Foot.

In the mean time, the Persian Fleet arriv'd at Aphetae, where discovering the
Smallness of the Grecian Fleet, which lay at Artemisium, the Persian Admirals
resolv'd to engage them; wherefore imagining, that the Grecians would
immediately fly at the first Motion of their Fleet, they sent 200 Sail,
ordering them to leave the Island Sciathus on their right, and launch into the
open Sea, lest, if they cruis'd too near Euboea, they should be seen by the
Enemy: And as soon as they pass'd Geraestus and Caphareus, lying upon the
extreme parts of Euboea, near the Mouth of the Straits, to sail up the River
Euripus, and fall upon the Grecians behind, while the rest of the Fleet, which
lay at Aphetae, attack'd them before, by which means they hop'd to destroy the
whole Grecian Fleet.

After all, it must be allow'd, that Queen Elizabeth had some Faults, and was
guilty of some Severities which can hardly be excused, unless she thought them
necessary to the Safety of her Person, and the Peace of her Kingdoms; wherein
too she might possibly be mistaken.

And if we consider, that she had for Enemies, France and Spain, the Pope, and
all the Catholick Powers, who deny'd her Title; that the Queen of Scotland was
supported by all those Powers, in her Pretensions to her Crown; that her own
Roman-Catholick Subjects wish'd to have her dethroned, and were often in Plots
for that Purpose, in which they were encourag'd by foreign Powers, that the
Irish, who were strongly attach'd to the Pope, were rebellious, and occasion'd
many intestine Commotions in that Kingdom: And yet that in the Midst of all
she, without any Allies, supported herself thro' a long and glorious Reign:
defeated all the Projects of her Enemies, and kept the Crown unshaken on her
Head to the last, purely by her good Policy, and the Affection, Zeal and
Loyalty of her faithful Subjects, whom by her wise Behaviour she attach'd
firmly to her Interest: I say, if we consider all these Things, her vast and
surprizing Abilities will evidently appear.

Charles's Design was to amuse Elizabeth and all the Protestants, particularly
the Huguenots, with whom he had made a perfidious Peace till he had drawn them
into the Snare, in order to destroy them by Treachery, when he found it
difficult to do it by open Force; which accordingly happened the next Year in
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, in which Admiral Chatillon, and all those
Huguenots who had been drawn to Court under Pretence of celebrating the
Nuptials of the King of Navarre with Charles's Sister, were inhumanly
butcher'd; tho' there were still enough left to occasion him further Trouble.

Nevertheless, even after this, the highest Protestations of Friendship pass'd
between the two Courts, Charles being afraid of the Queen of $England $'s
assisting the Huguenots, and she being willing to gain Time, that she might
penetrate farther into the Designs of her Enemies; so that the Huguenots could
not tell what to make of their good Protectress, who had even gone so far as
to stand Godmother to Charles's new-born Daughter, after the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; which might make one believe, that her Zeal for the Protestant
Religion was always subordinate to her private Interest. Tho' this must be
observ'd, that she ordered her Ambassador, who was to represent her, not to be
present at the Mass in the Ceremony of the Christening; and if it should be
insisted on, to get the Queen of Navarre to stand in his Room.

Philip had been long making vast Preparations in all his Ports, for an
Expedition against England; which was to have been executed last Year, but was
retarded by the Queen's sending Drake to the Coast of Spain, who burnt a great
Number of Ships laden with Provisions and Stores, together with two large
Galleons, and afterwards took a rich Carack coming from the East-Indies; as
also by that great Statesman $Walsingham $'s getting all the Spanish Bills,
which were to supply King Philip with Money, protested at Genoa.

It does not seem visionary to state, that it would have certainly been one of
the first employments of the Roman indignation to have exterminated them by an
expedition like those of Drusus, Germanicus, and Maximin, if the confederation
of the Francs had not interposed an impregnable barrier, and kept the imperial
armies employed on the south banks of the Rhine.

The situation of the Saxons on the sea-coast of that part of Europe, which was
in the neighbourhood of some fertile provinces of the Roman empire, and yet

circumstances propitious to a system of piracy.
