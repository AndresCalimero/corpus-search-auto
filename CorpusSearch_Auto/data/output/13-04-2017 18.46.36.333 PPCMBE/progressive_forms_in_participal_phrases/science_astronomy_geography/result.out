In this undertaking, I was much assisted by a set of short and easy theorems I
had laid down for calculating all the particulars respecting the motions of
satellites; such as, finding the longitude of the satellite from the angle of
position, or the position from the longitude: the inclination of the orbit
from the angle of position and longitude: the apogee: the greatest elongation:
and other particulars.

If any doubt should arise, on account of the suspicion not being verified with
480, I must remark, that being used to such imperfect glimpses, it has
generally turned out, even when I have given up as improbable the existence of
a supposed satellite seen in that manner, that it has afterwards nevertheless
been discovered that a small star remained in the place where the satellite
had been suspected to be situated.

After having been used to follow up the satellites of Saturn and Jupiter, to
the very margin of their planets, so as even to measure the apparent diameter
of one of Jupiter's satellites by its entrance on the disk, I was in hopes
that a similar opportunity would soon have offered with the Georgian
satellites: not indeed to measure the satellites, but to measure the planet
itself, by means of the passage of the satellite over its disk.

If the Italians, for example, in the early part of the twelfth century, had
discovered at Amalphi, instead of the pandects of Justinian, some ancient
manuscripts filled with astronomical observations relating to a period of
three thousand years, and made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical
instruments as perfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on
consulting these memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a
great revolution in the solar and sidereal systems.

This observation was necessary to explain the capital discovery which Dr.
Franklin made with respect to the manner of charging the Leyden phial; which
is, that when one side of the glass was electrified positively or plus, the
other side was electrified negatively or minus; so that whatever quantity of
fire is thrown upon one side of the glass, the same is thrown out of the other;
and that there is really no more electric fire in the phial after it is
charged than before; all that can be done by charging, being to take from one
side, and convey to the other.

He says, that when a tube lined with any non-electric is rubbed, what is
collected from the hand by the downward stroke enters the pores of the glass,
driving an equal quantity out of the inner surface, into the non-electric
lining; and that the hand, in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out
again what had been thrown into the outward surface, the inner surface at the
same time receiving back again what it had given to the non-electric lining;
so that the particles of the electric fluid went in and out of their pores,
upon every stroke given to the tube.

That the electric fire resided in the glass, was also further evident from
this consideration, that when glass was gilt, the discharging of it would make
a round hole, tearing off a part of the gilding, which, the Doctor thought,
could only have been done by the fire coming out of the glass through the
gilding.

He also says, that when the gilding was varnished even with turpentine, this
varnish, though dry and hard, would be burnt by the spark driven through it,
yielding a strong smell, and a visible smoak. Also, that when a spark was
driven through paper, it would be blackened by the smoke, which sometimes
penetrated several of the leaves, and that part of the gilding which had been
torn off was found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the
stroke.

It was Dr. Franklin who first proposed a method of verifying this hypothesis,
entertaining the bold thought, as the Abbe` Nollet expresses it, of bringing
lightning from the heavens, of thinking that pointed iron rods, fixed in the
air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the
matter of the thunderbolt, and discharge it without noise or danger into the
immense body of the earth, where it would remain as it were absorbed.

Dr. Franklin endeavoured to account for this effect of pointed bodies, by
supposing that the base on which the electric fluid at the point of an
electrified body rested, being small, the attraction by which the fluid was
held to the body was slight; and that, for the same reason, the resistance to
the entrance of the fluid was proportionably weaker in that place than where
the surface was flat.

are more frequent, and their effects, in that dry air, more dreadful, than

Dr. Franklin, retaining the common opinion, that electrified bodies have real
atmospheres of the electric fluid consisting of particles at some distance
from the surface of the body, but always going along with it observed that
these atmospheres and the air did not seem to exclude one another; though, he
says, this be difficult to conceive, considering that they are generally
supposed to repel one another.
