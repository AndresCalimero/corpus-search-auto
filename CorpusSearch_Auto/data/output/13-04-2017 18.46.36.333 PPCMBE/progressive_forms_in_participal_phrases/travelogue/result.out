But the scenery in a quiet way is charming. A sea of hills, in short, that
mostly reach a thousand feet, and seldom rise much more; a labyrinth of narrow
valleys, where crystal streams go prattling over verdant meads. A land where
oak woods blow in much luxuriance on the lower slopes, and sweet sheep
pastures share the hill-tops with breaks of golden furze; where villages and
ancient but meagrely attended churches nestle in ideal nooks, and a profoundly
peaceful rural life untapped by railroads, untouched by mines or quarries, or
tourists, defies the outer world, and remains, above all things, Welsh of the

In speaking of the several Adventurers into the South Sea, we brought Sir
Francis Drake to the North Part of the Coast of Peru, whence he continu'd his
Course still Northward, out at Sea, without ever touching, or coming in Sight
of the Coast of New Spain, 'till the 5th of June 1578, when being in the
Latitude of 43 Degrees, and finding it very cold, he stood in for the Land,
which they tell us was not mountainous, and fell into a good Bay, in 38
