I have been employed hitherto in proving that the power of the wicked, which
appeared to you the most shameful thing in the universe, is, in reality,
nothing; that their wickedness never escapes unpunished, punished,
notwithstanding the disagreeable idea you entertained to the contrary: that
their liberty to do evil, which you wished might soon come to an end, is not
of long duration: that the longer it continues, they are so much the more
miserable; and that if it were to continue for ever, their misery would be
infinite: that, in fine, if the wicked escaped by an unjust exemption from
punishment, they would be more unhappy than if they were chastised according
to their demerits; and consequently, that they are never more rigorously
punished, than when they are supposed not to suffer for their crimes,

Whether it be by the agency of spirits, attendants upon providence, that
Destiny operates, or by a soul, or by the ministry of the whole frame of
nature, or by the influence of the stars, or by the power of angels, or the
unwearied industry of demons; or whether it be by any one of these things, or
by all of them together, that the chain of Destiny is formed; it is evident
Providence is the invariable, the simple, and uncompounded train of conducting
every thing; and that Destiny is the fluctuating contexture and temporal
