When the Court considers that the Lenox lay close a-stern of the Cornwal,
whilst she continued in Action, so that when the Cornwal quitted the Line by
reason of her shortening and backening Sail, and the Lenox keeping her Course,
and busily employed in hot Action, it was morally impossible to avoid falling
foul of her one way or other. If any Blame lies on this Occasion, when the
Court takes into Consideration, that Part of my Weather Maintopsail Yard-Arm,
and the Head of my Foretop-Mast Staysail were shot away, with the other Damage
in my Rigging, whereby it became impracticable to manage the Ship so readily
as otherwise might be; and that the Cornwal's Maintop-Mast being shot away,
together with her shortening and backening Sail, I leave it to your Judgment
to determine on whom the Blame lies;

Sir, We humbly conceive it is our Duty to represent to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that in the Action between his Majesty's Squadron, and that
of Spain, which happened on the first of Octob. 1748, near the Havanna, that
by Rear-Admiral Knowles's bad Conduct, mistaken Signals, and $Un-Officerlike
Attack, he gave great Advantage to the Enemy; by engaging in a straggling Line
a superior Squadron drawn up in a close Line of Battle, late in the Day, when
he might have attacked them much earlier, and to greater Advantage. That his
Majesty's Ship Cornwal was not in the Action an Hour. That to the great
Dishonour of the British Flag, Rear-Admiral Knowles, not only unnecessarily
carried, but kept his Majesty's Flag out of Action. That he has endeavoured to
deceive his Majesty, their Lordships, and the Publick, by having transmitted a
false and injurious Account of the said Action, to Mr. Corbet, by Letter of
the 2d of October 1748; all which we are ready to prove,

I am the more Confident there could be no Reason for my doing so, because on
the second Day after the Action, viz. on the third of Oct. 1748, the
Rear-Admiral order'd me, by Letter, to take with the Lenox, the Oxford,
Warwick and Canterbury, and chase the Ships in Sight, but if I could not come
up with them before Night, be sure to join him again, that we might get

At length, dear sister, I am safely arrived with all my family in good health
at Peterwaradin; having suffered so little from the rigour of the season
against which we were well provided by furs and found such tolerable
accommodation every where, by the care of sending before, that I can hardly
forbear laughing when I recollect all the frightful ideas that were given me
of this journey.

I have sometimes thought that the real test of a schoolmaster or mistress
would be whether the children go on after they have left school liking to
inform themselves, liking to observe, liking to read up a thing: or whether
they forget all they have been taught, never to open a book, and even forget
how to read or write correctly. worse still, forget religion & morality.

My dear Sir Most heartily do I give you joy on the success of your 'Health at
Home' Education Mission - the enthusiastic attendance on your Lectures of
rural educated women from all over the County allowed to attend for their own
profit - your sifting & re-sifting till you obtained a Class of 12, who
appeared willing & able to become instructresses or missioners of Health to
the uneducated rural women at their own homes - the object of the whole course
being the new one not simply to give Sanitary information but to teach how to
teach - the examination by an independent well-known Sanitary authority - both
in writing & by word of mouth to test their power of speaking to the
uneducated And six of them passing the Exam'n with the utmost success three
indeed above what had been expected. the main object of the Exam'n being to
see not only if their book knowledge or theory were competent but if they
could give in the most practical & plainest, in the most lively & dramatic
manner - their knowledge to uneducated women in their own houses - translate
in fact the object-lessons they had received from your skill & kindness in the
worst houses of the worst villages - into the cottage life with their own
hands & tongue.

As you ask me, I venture to think that the one thing to call Nurses' attention
to 'now' is 1. the need of what no Cert'e can certify, no Exam'n can touch and
2. the necessity of attaching herself to some Home with motherly & trained
supervision, so that she may have some 'esprit de corps' to guide & support
her.

The modern tendencies seem to be to let out Nurses like Plumbers - for so many
hours a day to the Wards - Sisters or Head Nurses included - & then to let
them live for the remaining hours quite apart from the Hospital - wanting the
motherly element altogether - essential to a Nurse who is not a Plumber - but
has the care of soul & body in her Patients, & in her Assistant Nurses to
certify them as Plumbers. 2 to substitute the literary Nurse for the practical
Nurse who is to be raised by the moral side quite as much as by the technical
side - to have a spirit put into her quite as much as a hand.

fall into the hands of the Allies to officers to be appointed by the King of
France. That the intendants or principal Commissaries of the several armies
should be put in communication with these officers to be appointed by the King
of France, and should make upon them the requisitions for the several supplies
they should require for their armies respectively; that the King of $France
$'s officers should enforce these requisitions upon the country, taking care
to give to the owners proper receipts and vouchers for the property taken from
them; and that these receipts and vouchers should be taken up, and should be a

was desirous of having the influence of his Majesty's name to give to that
success all the advantages which it could derive; and because I was aware that
it would occasion a crisis in the King's affairs, particularly at Paris, to
take advantage of which I wished His Majesty should be on the spot, or as near
