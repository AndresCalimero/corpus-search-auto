Denmark, with some other great Persons, were gone off, from the King, to the
Prince of Orange, and that the Princess Anne, fearing the King her $Father $'s
Resentment might fall upon her, for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her
self, in the Night, from London, and was then within half a Days Journey of
Nottingham; on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News, that
two thousand of the King's Dragoons were in close pursuit to bring her back

Personal Morals, and Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an
Impediment, that it will be oftner a just Reason for his being receiv'd among
People of condition with Favour; and sometimes with a more social Distinction,
than the best, though more profitable Trade he might have follow'd, could have
recommended him to. That this is a Happiness to which several Actors, within
my Memory, as Betterton, Smith, Montfort, Captain Griffin, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle yet living have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated
Mrs. Oldfield.

Not to dwell too long therefore upon that Part of my History, which I have
only collected, from oral Tradition, I shall content my self with telling you
that Mohun, and Hart now growing old for, above thirty Years before this Time,
they had severally born the King's Commission of Major and Captain, in the
Civil Wars, and the younger Actors, as Goodman, Clark, and others, being
impatient to get into their Parts, and growing intractable, the Audiences too
of both Houses then falling off, the Patentees of each, by the King's Advice,
which perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests, and both
Companies into one, exclusive of all others, in the Year 1684.

the Account of them by observing, that, on the 24th of January 1729-30, he was

upon him, when, in the Beginning of the Year 1715, he intrusted him with the
important Dispatches, relating to a Discovery, which by a Series of admirable
Policy he had made, of a Design which the French King was then forming, for

apprehended they were so sure of Success, that it seemed a Point of Friendship
in one of the chief Counsellors of that Court, to dissuade a Dependent of his
from accepting some Employment under his Britannick Majesty, when proposed by
his Envoy there; because it was said, that in less than Six Weeks there would
be a Revolution, in favour of what they called the Family of the Stewarts.

Conversion; which I $can $not enter upon without assuring my Reader, that I

for concealing the most extraordinary from many Persons, to whom he mentioned
some of the rest.

a Religious Education; after having been hardned, rather than subdued, by the
most singular Mercies, even various, repeated, and astonishing Deliverances,
which have appeared to themselves as no less than miraculous; after having
lived for Years without God in the world, notoriously corrupt themselves, and
labouring to the utmost to corrupt others, have been stopt on a sudden in the
full Career of their Sin, and have felt such Rays of the Divine Presence, and
of Redeeming Love, darting in upon their Minds, almost like Lightning from
Heaven, as have at once rouzed, over-powered, and transformed them: So that

Divine Being, and of the admirable Tendency of the Christian revelation, that
he resolved to spend the Remainder of his Life, while God continued him out of
Hell, in as rational and as useful a Manner as he could; and to continue
casting himself at the Feet of Divine Mercy, every day, and often in a day, if
peradventure there might be Hope of Pardon, of which all that he could say was,
that he did not absolutely despair.

And indeed, when I consider how habitual all those criminal Indulgences were
grown to him, and that he was now in the Prime of Life, and all this while in
high Health too, I $can $not but be astonished to reflect upon it, that he
should be so wonderfully sanctified in Body, as well as in Soul and Spirit, as
that, for all the future Years of his Life, he, from that Hour should find so
constant a Disinclination to, and Abhorrence of, those criminal Sensualities,
to which he fancied he was before so invincibly impelled by his very
Constitution, that he was used strangely to think, and to say, that
Omnipotence itself could not reform him, without destroying that Body, and
giving him another.

to those who have been used to a sick room, when it says in the morning he
asked the hour, they told him six, he answered, all went on regularly, he felt
he had but a few hours to live, every thing rushed into mind, all the
accompaniments, the expiring rush light, as day begins to break, the
attendants stalking about gently after sitting up all night, whispering to
each other and now & then drawing back the window curtain to see how near the
day, the Stars twinkling like gems, as if they were doing their utmost before
they are extinguished by the Sun - and Johnson with proven energy in his
expiring awful voice begging mercy at intervals of the Almighty.

I remember Captain Debrisay, who, upwards of seventy years of age, walked the
streets of Dublin unremarked, in the old dress, worn in the days of Charles
the Second; a large cocked hat, all on one side his face, nearly covering his
left eye; a great powdered wig, hanging at the side in curls, and in the
centre at the back a large black cockade, with a small drop curl from it; his
embroidered waistcoat down to his knees; the top of his coat not within three
inches of his neck, the hip buttons about a foot from it; buttons all the way
down the coat, but only one at the waist buttoned; the hilt of the sword
through the opening of the skirt; a long cravat, fringed, the end pulled
through the third button-hole; small buckles; the coat sleeves very short, and
the shirt sleeves pulled down, but hid by the top of the gloves, and the
ruffles hanging out at the opening of the cuff; the waistcoat entirely open
except the lower button, displaying the finely plaited frill.

As we were going out of Calais, I noticed that the large plain, in which that
town is situated, is merely an extent of sea beach, being for miles composed
of loose rolled pebbles, in some places covered with very thin vegetable soil
which has been made capable of affording nourishment to a little corn, but
more frequently entirely bare, tossed into low hillocks, and having every
appearance of having just been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them
there.

engrossed and himself was of the committee that prepared it, stood up and told
the House he had found out a fault in the bill which he did not doubt but they
would all be sensible of, and it was about the word now, but he was
immediately answered by Mr. Vernon, Mr. Walpole, Stanhope and other of the

the consent of the traders to that sea, Denmark taking upon itself the charge
of constructing lighthouses, and erecting signals, to mark the shoals and

all ships should pass this way, in order that all might pay their shares: none
from that time using the passage of the Belt; because it was not fitting that

chief merit, that he did not realise the least the deadly character of his own

if it $can $not be helped, to have them with eyes opened as being the best
that can be got, instead of whitewashing the sepulchre.

getting better work done later, and to substitute for it English in three
aspects. First, English Grammar and Language Analysis, in which English is to
be worked as we have hitherto worked the classics; secondly, English knowledge
of a common sort, e. g. air, physical geography, natural history, etc.;
thirdly, a more complete preparation of the Latin lessons from an English
point of view, etc., better translations, explanations of Latin by English.
